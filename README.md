# Z-Band Prime Prefilter

![Z-Band Prime Prefilter hero](docs/assets/z-band-prime-prefilter-hero.jpg)

Deterministic cryptographic prime prefiltering whose production path is a bounded small-factor screen in front of fixed-base Miller-Rabin. The invariant target for that surrogate is the prime fixed point implied by the exact **Divisor Normalization Identity** (DNI) $Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}$ at normalization scaling parameter $v = e^{2}/2$.

This repository presents the Z-Band Prime Prefilter as a deterministic cryptographic primitive. It gives the mathematical basis of the method, centered on the **Divisor Normalization Identity** (DNI) $Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}$, a production Python implementation, and the validation vectors and benchmarks needed to reproduce the result.

## Scope At A Glance

- The exact DNI is an arithmetic identity under exact divisor count.
- The production prefilter does not compute exact divisor count on cryptographic-size candidates at runtime.
- In the production path, `proxy_z = 1.0` means only that the candidate survived the current gated factor tables and therefore advances to Miller-Rabin. It is not a primality proof by itself.
- The reported `~91%` Miller-Rabin reduction is the measured consequence of the current covered odd-prime table depth on the tested deterministic streams, not a runtime evaluation of exact DNI. See [docs/prefilter/benchmarks.md](docs/prefilter/benchmarks.md) and the table-depth sweep discussed there.
- The gap-ridge notes study the exact raw composite `Z` field inside prime gaps. That is a separate empirical concern from the production prefilter.

## Terminology

This repository uses precise language to name structural roles inside one discrete arithmetic normalization. The terminology is intended literally within that setting. It does not claim that the integers in this repository have been equipped with a smooth Riemannian manifold structure or a physical time evolution.

- **Divisor normalization load** names the scalar quantity $\kappa(n) = d(n)\ln(n)/e^2$. It measures how far an integer has moved away from the minimal-divisor prime case once divisor structure and logarithmic scale are combined.
- **Z-Band** names the straight fixed-point regime selected by the normalization. Under the exact DNI, primes occupy the fixed-point locus $Z = 1.0$, while composites deviate below it as additional factor structure appears.
- **Normalization scaling parameter** names the scalar $v$ in the Z-transform $Z(n) = n / \exp(v \cdot \kappa(n))$. The distinguished value $v = e^2/2$ is the fixed-point parameter because it produces the exact collapse $Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}$.
- **Fixed-point locus** names the normalized set $Z = 1.0$ picked out by the exact identity for the prime class.
- **Ridge** names a measured concentration of local maxima in the exact raw composite Z-field inside prime gaps.

## Overview

Every positive integer has a divisor pattern.

- A prime has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.
- A composite has additional positive divisors.

This distinction is the starting point. A number with more exact divisors carries more internal factor structure than a number with fewer. Divisor count alone, however, is not enough, because the same divisor count does not mean the same thing at different scales. The approach therefore combines divisor structure with logarithmic size.

The logarithmic term accounts for magnitude in a balanced way. It registers growth in size without letting raw magnitude overwhelm the structural signal. Moving from $10$ to $100$ to $1000$ produces steady increments, so divisor structure can be compared meaningfully across small and large integers.

The resulting combined quantity is called the divisor normalization load. This load measures the departure of an integer from the minimal divisor case. This is the simplest structure represented by a prime. Primes have the lowest load. As additional exact divisors appear, the integer carries more internal branching relative to that baseline. When divisor structure and logarithmic scale are taken together, this accumulated departure is the quantity denoted by $\kappa(n)$.

We call the resulting law the **Divisor Normalization Equation**:

$$
\kappa(n) = \frac{d(n) \cdot \ln(n)}{e^{2}}
$$

where:

- $d(n)$ is the divisor count of $n$
- $\ln(n)$ is the natural logarithm of $n$
- $e^{2}$ is the normalization constant

This equation measures how much factor structure an integer carries once scale is taken into account. With the divisor normalization load defined, primes are the minimal case under this measure, while composites carry increasingly more structural load. This is the sense in which the framework speaks of straightness or load in the discrete integer field used in this repository.

## Divisor Normalization Identity

The divisor normalization load signal becomes useful when it is passed through the Z-transform:

$$
Z(n) = \frac{n}{\exp(v \cdot \kappa(n))}
$$

where $v$ is the normalization scaling parameter.

For the Z-Band Prime Prefilter, the distinguished value is

$$
v = \frac{e^{2}}{2}
$$

because it produces an exact cancellation. Substitute the Divisor Normalization Equation into the Z-transform:

$$
Z(n) = \frac{n}{\exp\left(v \cdot \frac{d(n) \cdot \ln(n)}{e^{2}}\right)}
$$

Now set $v = e^{2}/2$:

$$
\begin{align*}
Z(n) &= \frac{n}{\exp\left(\frac{e^{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{d(n) \cdot \ln(n)}{e^{2}}\right)} \\
&= \frac{n}{\exp\left(\frac{d(n)}{2} \cdot \ln(n)\right)} \\
&= \frac{n}{n^{d(n)/2}} \\
&= n^{1 - d(n)/2}
\end{align*}
$$

So the **Divisor Normalization Identity** (DNI) $Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}$ is

$$
Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}
$$

This has an immediate effect:

- Prime: $d(p) = 2$, so $Z(p) = 1$
- Semiprime with two distinct prime factors: $d(n) = 4$, so $Z(n) = 1/n$
- Composite in general: $d(n) > 2$, so $Z(n) < 1$

Under the exact DNI, the entire prime class collapses to the fixed-point locus $Z = 1.0$. Composites are pushed strictly below that locus.

## Why This Becomes a Prefilter

This fixed-point separation is the practical core of the method. Cryptographic prime generation spends most of its time on candidates that are composite and never need a full probable-prime path. The exact DNI provides the invariant target. The production implementation below is the bounded deterministic surrogate calibrated against that target rather than a runtime exact-divisor evaluator.

Because confirmed primes live at $Z = 1.0$ under the DNI and composites contract below it, the prefilter creates a clean structural separation in normalized space. That separation makes it possible to reject many candidates before paying the full cost of the survivor regime.

## Production Filter

The exact DNI depends on exact divisor count. That exact path is valuable as the derivation and as the oracle, but it is not the runtime path for cryptographic-scale key generation.

The production implementation in this repository therefore uses a deterministic surrogate with the same invariant target:

- generate deterministic odd candidates from a SHA-256 namespace/index stream
- reject immediately when a concrete factor appears in the gated prime tables
- keep survivors on the locus convention `proxy_z = 1.0`
- run fixed-base Miller-Rabin on survivors
- apply final `sympy.isprime` confirmation in the current Python path

So the logic flows in one direction:

- the Divisor Normalization Equation defines the structural signal
- the normalization scaling parameter turns that signal into the prime DNI locus
- the locus creates a usable structural separation
- the production filter exploits that separation to reduce Miller-Rabin work

The current measured rejection rate comes from the covered prime-table depth of this implementation. The repository includes deterministic table-depth sweeps to show that dependence directly rather than attributing the `~91%` figure to runtime exact DNI evaluation.

Empirically, this extracted Python path produced:

- $2.09\times$ end-to-end speedup across $300$ deterministic $2048$-bit RSA keypairs
- $2.82\times$ end-to-end speedup across $50$ deterministic $4096$-bit RSA keypairs
- $90.97\,\%$ to $91.07\,\%$ Miller-Rabin reduction in the current covered-table configuration

### DNI Calibration

- $0$ composite false fixed points

### Exact Raw Composite Z Field

- This is a separate exact-field concern from the production prefilter.
- Up to `10^6` on the natural number line, the strongest exact raw composite `Z` value inside a prime gap lands at edge distance `2` in `43.6006%` of gaps versus an exact within-gap baseline of `22.1859%`, and is carried by a `d(n) = 4` composite in `82.9027%` of gaps versus a baseline of `20.1401%`.
- Later repository notes narrow and sharpen that result: the broader "prime-edge insulation" picture is explicitly falsified, while the surviving tested winner rule is that the gap-local raw-`Z` peak matches the lexicographic choice "minimize interior divisor count, then take the leftmost carrier" on exact `10^7` and sampled regimes through `10^10`.
