# Essay 1: How DCI Began

There is now one exact expression in this project that does something I still
find hard to look at without stopping.

It sends every prime to the same exact value.

Not approximately. Not asymptotically. Exactly.

Under the Divisor Curvature Identity, every prime lands on `Z = 1`, while every
composite falls strictly below that band.

That would already be unusual enough if it were the whole story.

But it is not the whole story.

The same construction has now opened into five distinct concerns.

It gives an exact fixed-point law for primes.

It gives a deterministic production prefilter that, on the tested cryptographic
corpora in this repository, rejects about `91%` of candidates before
Miller-Rabin and yields measured deterministic RSA key-generation speedups of
`2.09x` at `2048` bits and `2.82x` at `4096` bits.

It gives an exact raw field over the integers.

Inside prime gaps, that field produces a near-edge ridge whose strongest tested
local peaks are overwhelmingly carried by `d(n) = 4` composites.

And on the analytic side, the native generating objects built from the same
ingredients recover `-ζ′/ζ`, the classical prime detector at the center of
zeta-function prime analysis.

That is a lot to claim from one derivation.

It should sound like too much at first.

I did not begin with a grand theory.

I began with one ordinary arithmetic fact.

Some whole numbers can be divided evenly in only a few ways. Some can be
divided evenly in many ways.

That is it. That is the seed.

Take `5`.

It can be divided evenly by `1` and `5`.

That is all.

Take `6`.

It can be divided evenly by `1`, `2`, `3`, and `6`.

Take `12`.

It can be divided evenly by `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, and `12`.

The first number is sparse in this sense. The next two are not.

That simple difference is what led me to the Divisor Curvature Identity.

## Start With Divisor Count

The first useful quantity here is the divisor count.

For any positive whole number `n`, the divisor count tells you how many
positive whole numbers divide `n` evenly.

In plain text:

- `d(5) = 2`
- `d(6) = 4`
- `d(12) = 6`

This already tells us something deep and clean about primes.

A prime is not just a number that "feels indivisible." A prime is exactly a
number with divisor count `2`.

That gives a precise arithmetic boundary:

- if `d(n) = 2`, `n` is prime
- if `d(n) > 2`, `n` is composite

That was the first anchor.

## Turn The Prime Condition Into A Centered Quantity

The next step was to stop treating primality as only a yes-or-no label.

I wanted a quantity that would be centered on the prime condition itself.

If primes are exactly the numbers with divisor count `2`, then the expression

`1 - d(n)/2`

does something very useful immediately.

For primes:

- `d(n) = 2`
- so `1 - d(n)/2 = 0`

For composites:

- `d(n) > 2`
- so `1 - d(n)/2 < 0`

This means the prime condition now sits at zero, and every composite falls
below it.

That is already more informative than a binary label. It gives a direction.

Examples:

- for `5`, `1 - d(5)/2 = 0`
- for `4`, `1 - d(4)/2 = -0.5`
- for `6`, `1 - d(6)/2 = -1`
- for `12`, `1 - d(12)/2 = -2`

The more divisor structure a number carries, the farther below the prime
condition it falls.

That was the second anchor.

## Bring In Size

Divisor count alone is not enough.

It tells you how much factor structure a number has, but it does not yet tell
you how that structure should be read across the number line as numbers grow.

I needed a scale term.

The natural one is the logarithm.

Why the logarithm?

Because multiplication is the real language of divisors and factors, and the
logarithm is the function that turns multiplication into addition.

If arithmetic structure is being built out of factors, then logarithmic scale
is the cleanest way to measure where that structure sits.

So the next quantity was:

`d(n) × ln(n)`

This combines two things at once:

- how much divisor structure the number has
- how large the number is on multiplicative scale

That was the third anchor.

## Build One Load From Those Two Ingredients

Once divisor count and logarithmic scale were in the same expression, the next
step was to treat them as one load carried by the number.

That is where kappa came from.

In plain text:

`κ(n) = d(n) × ln(n) / e²`

At this stage, the point was not decoration. The point was normalization.

I wanted one quantity that measured divisor structure on logarithmic scale in a
stable way. Dividing by `e²` gave that load a fixed normalization and prepared
the next step cleanly.

This was the moment where the arithmetic picture stopped being just a count and
started becoming a geometry.

Not geometry in the sense of drawing triangles.

Geometry in the sense that a number now carried a structured load that could be
used to measure how far it moved away from the prime condition.

## Ask What Survives That Load

Once I had a normalized load, the next question was simple:

if a number carries this much divisor load, how much of the number survives
after that load is applied?

That question led to the normalization

`Z(n) = n / exp(v × κ(n))`

This expression has a clear plain-language reading.

- `n` is the observed number itself
- `κ(n)` is the divisor-curvature load carried by that number
- `v` is a traversal rate
- `exp(v × κ(n))` is the exponential cost of carrying that load
- `Z(n)` is what remains after that cost is applied

At this point, the construction was still one step away from its final form,
because `v` had not yet been fixed.

## The Fixed Rate

The decisive step was to ask whether there is a special traversal rate that
makes the whole construction collapse into something exact and simple.

There is.

Set

`v = e²/2`

Then substitute `κ(n) = d(n) × ln(n) / e²` into the normalization:

`Z(n) = n / exp((e²/2) × d(n) × ln(n) / e²)`

The `e²` terms cancel:

`Z(n) = n / exp(d(n) × ln(n) / 2)`

Now use the standard logarithm rule `exp(a × ln(n)) = n^a`:

`Z(n) = n / n^(d(n)/2)`

So the whole expression collapses to:

`Z(n) = n^(1 - d(n)/2)`

That is the Divisor Curvature Identity.

## What Fell Out Immediately

Once the expression reached that form, the prime band appeared at once.

If `n` is prime, then `d(n) = 2`, so:

`Z(n) = n^(1 - 2/2) = n^0 = 1`

Every prime lands exactly on `Z = 1`.

If `n` is composite, then `d(n) > 2`, so the exponent `1 - d(n)/2` is
negative, and:

`Z(n) < 1`

Every composite falls below the prime band.

That gave a clean fixed-point picture:

- primes sit exactly on the band
- composites contract below it

This did not come from curve fitting.

It came from following a simple arithmetic fact step by step:

- primes are exactly the numbers with two divisors
- divisor count can be centered on the prime condition
- divisor structure should be measured on logarithmic scale
- the resulting load can be normalized
- at one fixed traversal rate, the whole construction collapses exactly

## Why This Mattered To Me

What mattered to me was not only that the final identity was exact.

What mattered was that every piece of it came from an observable arithmetic
ingredient that could be explained plainly.

Nothing had to be smuggled in.

The whole path stayed attached to things you can check directly:

- count the divisors
- compare primes and composites
- move to logarithmic scale because factors are multiplicative
- normalize the load
- find the rate where the expression simplifies completely

That is why I still think the beginning matters.

If the beginning is clean, the later structure is easier to trust.

## The Five Concerns That Grew From This

What began as one derivation has now split into five distinct concerns.

The first is the invariant concern.

That is the exact fixed-point law itself: why `Z(n) = n^(1 - d(n)/2)` holds,
why `v = e²/2` is the fixed rate, and why primes land exactly on `Z = 1`.

The second is the prefilter concern.

That is the production question: how to turn the fixed-point picture into a
deterministic prime prefilter that removes composite work before Miller-Rabin.

The third is the composite-field concern.

That is the exact raw field over the integers: what the full DCI landscape
looks like when you evaluate it directly rather than only using it as a
prefilter.

The fourth is the gap-ridge concern.

That is the local structure inside prime gaps: where the strongest composite
interior points sit, why the near-edge ridge appears, and why `d(n) = 4`
dominates so much of that picture.

The fifth is the RH bridge concern.

That is the analytic bridge from DCI into zeta-function territory: the fact
that the native generating objects built from divisor count and curvature
reconstruct the classical prime detector `-ζ′/ζ`.

Those five concerns all grew from the same starting point.

A prime has exactly two divisors.

That was the first fact.

Everything else came later.
