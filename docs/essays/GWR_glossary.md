# GWR Glossary

This glossary is for readers who want to understand the `GWR` finding notes
and essays without already knowing the project vocabulary.

The goal is plain language first.

For each term, this glossary answers two questions:

- what the term means in ordinary language,
- what it means specifically in this repository.

This is not a formal theorem note.
It is a reading aid.

## How To Use This Glossary

If a term sounds grand or unfamiliar, do not assume it is standard number
theory language.

Many terms in this repo are:

- exact technical names for repo-specific objects,
- shorthand labels for quantities measured by a particular scan,
- or plain-language names for a structural reading of the current evidence.

So the right question is usually not “is this a standard textbook term?”

The right question is:

- what object is the repo pointing at,
- and how much of the claim is exact, measured, or interpretive?

This glossary will say that directly.

## Core Gap Terms

### Prime Gap

**Plain language:** The stretch of integers between one prime and the next.

**In this repo:** A prime gap is written as `(p, q)` where `p < q` are
consecutive primes.

Example:

- `(11, 17)` is a prime gap because the integers `12, 13, 14, 15, 16` lie
  between `11` and `17`, and there is no prime strictly between `11` and `17`.

### Gap Interior

**Plain language:** The integers that sit between the two bounding primes.

**In this repo:** For a gap `(p, q)`, the interior is all integers `n` with
`p < n < q`.

### Consecutive Primes

**Plain language:** Two primes with no other prime in between.

**In this repo:** The project almost always studies primes in this local pair
form, because `GWR` is about what happens inside the interval bounded by one
prime and the next.

### Winner

**Plain language:** The interior composite that “wins” under the repo’s score.

**In this repo:** The winner is the interior integer that maximizes the
implemented log-score
`L(n) = (1 - d(n)/2) ln(n)`.

Under `GWR`, that winner is exactly the leftmost interior integer with the
smallest divisor count present in the gap.

### Carrier

**Plain language:** An integer that carries some divisor class or structural
role.

**In this repo:** “Carrier” usually means the actual integer where a particular
divisor class shows up.

Examples:

- “first `d=4` carrier” means the first interior integer with `d(n)=4`,
- “winner carrier” means the actual integer that wins the score.

### Divisor Count

**Plain language:** How many positive divisors a number has.

**In this repo:** Written as `d(n)`.

Examples:

- `d(7) = 2` because `7` has divisors `1, 7`,
- `d(9) = 3` because `9` has divisors `1, 3, 9`,
- `d(10) = 4` because `10` has divisors `1, 2, 5, 10`.

### Divisor Class

**Plain language:** The group of integers that share the same divisor count.

**In this repo:** Saying “the divisor class `4`” means the set of integers
with `d(n)=4`.

So:

- a `d=3` integer is in divisor class `3`,
- a `d=4` integer is in divisor class `4`.

This is one of the most important terms in the repo.

### Minimal Divisor Class

**Plain language:** The smallest divisor count that actually appears inside a
given gap.

**In this repo:** Often written as `d_min` or `δ_min`.

If a gap interior contains divisor classes `4`, `6`, and `8`, then the minimal
divisor class for that gap is `4`.

### Dominant `d=4` Regime

**Plain language:** The most common winner regime on the tested surface.

**In this repo:** Many tested gaps have winners with divisor count `4`, so the
repo often studies that case separately.

This matters because:

- `d=4` is the common winner class,
- the next strictly smaller composite class is then `d=3`,
- and `d=3` corresponds exactly to prime squares.

That makes the dominant regime much more concrete.

## GWR Terms

### GWR

**Plain language:** Short for `Gap Winner Rule`.

**In this repo:** The central prime-gap law being studied.

It says:

- find the smallest divisor count present in the gap interior,
- then take the leftmost interior integer with that divisor count,
- and that integer is exactly the score winner.

### Leftmost Tie-Break

**Plain language:** If two candidates are equally simple, the earlier one wins.

**In this repo:** This is built into the `GWR` rule.

If two interior integers have the same minimal divisor count, the one closer to
the left prime wins.

### Left Flank

**Plain language:** The part of the gap before the winner.

**In this repo:** Usually means all interior integers `n < w`, where `w` is
the winner.

### Right Flank

**Plain language:** The part of the gap after the winner.

**In this repo:** Usually means all interior integers `n > w` and still
strictly less than the right prime.

### Left-Prefix Exclusion

**Plain language:** Before the winner appears, the gap is not allowed to
contain anything equally simple or simpler.

**In this repo:** If `GWR` holds and the winner has divisor count `δ`, then
every earlier interior integer must satisfy `d(n) > δ`.

### Right-Suffix Exclusion

**Plain language:** After the winner appears, the gap is not allowed to
contain anything strictly simpler.

**In this repo:** If `GWR` holds and the winner has divisor count `δ`, then
every later interior integer must satisfy `d(n) >= δ`.

### Divisor-Profile Admission Condition

**Plain language:** The required shape of the divisor counts across a gap if
`GWR` holds.

**In this repo:** This is the profile

`>δ, >δ, ..., >δ, δ, >=δ, >=δ, ..., >=δ`

where `δ` is the winner’s divisor count.

It means the boundary primes are only allowed to bound interiors with that
general structure.

## Spoiler Terms

### Spoiler

**Plain language:** A candidate that could beat the intended winner.

**In this repo:** A spoiler is usually an earlier interior integer that might
have a larger score than the actual `GWR` carrier.

If such a candidate really beat the winner, `GWR` would fail on that gap.

### Earlier Spoiler

**Plain language:** A spoiler that appears before the winner inside the gap.

**In this repo:** This was the hard direction in the proof program. The
explicit bridge certificate now closes it under the recorded BHP/Robin
constants.

The right side is easier because later simpler candidates are ruled out by the
winner law and the dominance theorem. The difficult side is the earlier
higher-divisor candidates.

### Spoiler Candidate

**Plain language:** A candidate checked for whether it could be a spoiler.

**In this repo:** Not every spoiler candidate is a real spoiler. It is just an
interior integer that has to be checked.

### Spoiler Template

**Plain language:** A pattern of values or divisor classes that could act like
a spoiler if it were realized in an actual gap.

**In this repo:** This is an interpretive term, not a formal theorem term.

It usually means an abstract pattern that looks dangerous on paper, before
checking whether actual prime gaps ever realize it.

### Spoiler Family

**Plain language:** A whole infinite collection of spoiler-like patterns built
from one formula.

**In this repo:** The class-only obstruction families are examples. They show
that the current abstract inequality does not automatically eliminate every
possible dangerous class pattern.

### Divisor-Class Spoiler

**Plain language:** A spoiler discussed at the level of divisor counts rather
than at the level of one specific gap.

**In this repo:** This usually means talking about a pair like
“winner class `30`, earlier class `32`” rather than one single pair of
integers.

### Spoiler Threshold

**Plain language:** The boundary between safe and unsafe cases.

**In this repo:** For bridge load, the spoiler threshold is `B(k, w) = 1`.
Below `1` is safe. At or above `1` would be dangerous.

## Bridge Terms

### Bridge

**Plain language:** The argument connecting the exact finite base to the
large-scale theorem.

**In this repo:** “Bridge” often means the no-early-spoiler argument that turns
the exact finite base into a universal proof. The committed certificate now
records that the bridge threshold falls below the finite base under the stated
BHP/Robin constants.

### Bridge Load

**Plain language:** A normalized measure of how close an earlier candidate is
to becoming a true spoiler.

**In this repo:** Written as `B(k, w)`.

You can read it as:

- `B` near `0` means very safe,
- `B` near `1` means close to dangerous,
- `B >= 1` would mean the spoiler condition is no longer safely satisfied.

### Spoiler Budget

**Plain language:** How much room there is before a candidate becomes a true
spoiler.

**In this repo:** This is informal language for the same idea measured by
bridge load.

If bridge load is `0.0566`, the case is using only about `5.66%` of the
available budget before reaching the threshold `1`.

### Normalized

**Plain language:** Rescaled so values from different settings can be compared
on one common scale.

**In this repo:** Bridge load is normalized because it divides the realized
danger by the critical amount that would be needed for failure.

## Surface And Frontier Terms

### Surface

**Plain language:** The collection of cases measured by a particular scan or
artifact.

**In this repo:** A “surface” is often the whole output of one deterministic
run.

Examples:

- exact through-`2 × 10^7` surface,
- deterministic even-band surface through `10^18`,
- ratio-frontier surface.

### Exact Surface

**Plain language:** A range where every relevant case was checked, not a
sample.

**In this repo:** “Exact through `2 × 10^7`” means the scan checked the whole
range, not selected windows.

### Sampled Surface

**Plain language:** A deterministic selection of windows rather than the whole
number line up to that scale.

**In this repo:** The high-scale ladders often use deterministic sampled
windows rather than exhaustive enumeration.

### Danger Surface

**Plain language:** The part of the measured surface where cases come closest
to violating the target rule.

**In this repo:** This is informal language, not a formal theorem term.

When a note says “danger surface,” it means the region of the scan where the
cases look closest to becoming spoilers or failures.

### Frontier

**Plain language:** The edge of the measured surface where the hardest cases
live.

**In this repo:** “Frontier” means the nearest observed cases to failure or to
some target bound.

### Frontier Leaders

**Plain language:** The specific cases at the front of that hard edge.

**In this repo:** These are the currently hardest observed cases in a scan.

Example:

- a pair like `(30, 32)` may lead the ratio frontier because it comes closest
  to the spoiler threshold among the measured class pairs.

### Motif

**Plain language:** A small repeating local pattern.

**In this repo:** “Tiny motifs” usually means small gap structures such as
gap-`4` or gap-`6` cases that keep reappearing at the frontier.

### Gap-4 Motif

**Plain language:** A hard case living in a prime gap of length `4`.

**In this repo:** Several frontier notes report that the hardest observed exact
cases live in tiny gap-`4` configurations rather than in the largest gaps.

### Hard Regime

**Plain language:** The part of the problem where the cases are hardest.

**In this repo:** Often used for the scale, divisor classes, or local motifs
that come closest to failure.

## Closure Terms

### Closure

**Plain language:** The way the gap ends when the next prime arrives.

**In this repo:** “Closure” usually means whether the right endpoint prime
arrives before a later strictly simpler composite can appear.

### Closure Violation

**Plain language:** A case where the gap closes too late.

**In this repo:** A closure violation means the next prime did **not** arrive
before the relevant later simpler threat. That would contradict the closure
condition being tested.

### No-Later-Simpler-Composite

**Plain language:** Once the winner appears, no later interior integer should
be strictly simpler before the next prime arrives.

**In this repo:** This is both a conditional corollary of `GWR` and a theorem
candidate in its own right.

### Threat Horizon

**Plain language:** The first later point where a more dangerous simpler
candidate could appear.

**In this repo:** Written as `T_<(w)` in general. In the dominant `d=4`
regime, it becomes the next prime square after the winner.

### Prime-Arrival Margin

**Plain language:** How much room is left between the next prime and the
dangerous later threat.

**In this repo:** In the `d=4` case this is `S_+(w) - q`.
Positive means the prime arrived in time.

### Square-Phase Clock

**Plain language:** The countdown from a `d=4` winner to the next prime square.

**In this repo:** This is the repo’s way of making the dominant `d=4` closure
law concrete.

Since the next simpler composite class after `d=4` is `d=3`, and `d=3`
corresponds exactly to prime squares, the next prime square acts like the next
possible “tick” of a simpler threat.

### Square-Phase Utilization

**Plain language:** How much of the available prime-square clock gets used
before the next prime arrives.

**In this repo:** Written as
`U_square(w, q) = (q - w)/(S_+(w) - w)`.

Small utilization means the next prime arrives very early relative to the
available threat horizon.

## Admissibility Terms

### Admissibility

**Plain language:** Whether a pattern is actually allowed to occur.

**In this repo:** “Admissibility” usually means whether a divisor-arrival
pattern can really appear inside an actual gap between consecutive primes.

### Realizable

**Plain language:** Capable of actually occurring.

**In this repo:** A realizable pattern is one that can show up in an actual
prime gap, not just on paper in class-only algebra.

### Realized

**Plain language:** Actually observed in the measured scans.

**In this repo:** “Realized frontier” means the hardest cases that actually
occurred in the artifact surface.

### Class-Only

**Plain language:** Talking only about divisor-count classes, not about actual
prime-gap geometry.

**In this repo:** A class-only argument may show an abstract obstruction family
without proving that the corresponding pattern ever occurs inside a real gap.

### Admissibility Law

**Plain language:** A rule saying which interior patterns are allowed and which
are not.

**In this repo:** This is currently an interpretive target, not an established
theorem. It is the idea that prime gaps may obey stricter realizability rules
than the present comparison inequalities alone reveal.

### Admissibility Censorship

**Plain language:** Most dangerous-looking abstract patterns seem to be filtered
out before they ever appear in real gaps.

**In this repo:** This is the central interpretive finding of
`prime_gap_admissibility_censorship_finding.md`.

It does **not** mean the repo has proved a censorship theorem.

It means the current evidence suggests:

- many spoiler-like patterns are available in abstract class algebra,
- but only a thin subset seems to survive as actual gap interiors.

### Prime-Gap Admissibility Censorship

**Plain language:** The specific version of admissibility censorship for prime
gaps.

**In this repo:** Same idea as above, stated at the level of interiors bounded
by consecutive primes.

## Boundary Terms

### Boundary Placement

**Plain language:** Where the bounding primes are allowed to sit.

**In this repo:** A key newer reading is that the interior winner law does not
only rank composites. It also constrains where the right endpoint prime can
appear.

### Boundary-Placement Law

**Plain language:** A rule about allowed prime endpoints, not just interior
ranking.

**In this repo:** This is the main point of
`prime_boundary_placement_finding.md`.

### Admissible Stopping Region

**Plain language:** The interval inside which the next prime has to arrive for
the gap to stay valid.

**In this repo:** Informal language for the interval between the winner and the
later threat horizon.

### Winner As A Clock

**Plain language:** The winner determines a later time or position at which a
more dangerous simpler candidate could appear.

**In this repo:** This is especially concrete in the dominant `d=4` regime,
where the next prime square is the clock tick.

## Reading-Level Terms

### Exact

**Plain language:** Proven exactly or checked exhaustively on the stated finite
surface.

**In this repo:** Often means a full deterministic scan over the whole range.

### Empirical

**Plain language:** Measured by computation rather than proved from a theorem.

**In this repo:** Older `GWR` validation surfaces were empirical in this sense.
The current headline `GWR` result is a conditionally proven theorem under the
recorded BHP/Robin assumptions, not only a measured surface.

### Theorem Candidate

**Plain language:** A formal claim the repo takes seriously but has not yet
proved.

**In this repo:** Terms like `No-Later-Simpler-Composite Theorem` are currently
theorem candidates unless explicitly marked as exact corollaries.

### Finding

**Plain language:** A strong reading or measured result supported by the
current artifact surface.

**In this repo:** A finding may be very important, but it is not automatically
claimed as a universal theorem.

### Exact Corollary

**Plain language:** Something that follows immediately if the parent statement
is true.

**In this repo:** Several “prime placement” and “prefix/suffix exclusion”
statements are exact corollaries of `GWR`.

## Short Reading Tips

When a note feels unreadable, try this translation rule:

- “surface” means “the cases we measured,”
- “frontier” means “the hardest measured cases,”
- “spoiler” means “a candidate that could beat the winner,”
- “bridge load” means “how close that candidate comes,”
- “closure” means “whether the next prime arrives in time,”
- “admissibility” means “whether a pattern can actually happen in a real gap.”

If you want only one sentence to keep in your head, use this one:

`GWR` says, under the recorded BHP/Robin bridge constants, that prime gaps do
not allow arbitrary composite interiors: the raw-$Z$ winner is the leftmost
carrier of the minimum divisor class in the gap.
