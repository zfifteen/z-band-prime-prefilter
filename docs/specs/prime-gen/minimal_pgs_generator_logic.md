# Minimal PGS Generator Logic

Current production iteration:

```text
PGS Inference Generator v1.1
PGS_GENERATOR_VERSION = 1.1.0
PGS_GENERATOR_FREEZE_ID = pgs_inference_generator_v1_1_pgs_only
```

Release note:
[PGS Inference Generator v1.1](../../releases/pgs_inference_generator_v1_1_pgs_only.md).

The generator has one job: start from an input prime `p` and output the
next prime `q` selected by the PGS next-prime selection rule.

Each outputted line has exactly two keys:

```json
{"p": 11, "q": 13}
```

`q` is the generator's PGS-selected next-prime output. A separate downstream
audit checks every outputted record after generation. Audit is verification, not
the mechanism that chooses `q`.

## Stage 1: Input Prime

The input prime `p` is the current accepted prime. The generator accepts `p` as
input. It does not prove `p` during generation.

For every resolved input prime, the generator outputs exactly one record. If the PGS
selector does not resolve inside the supplied search bound, the generator
raises `PGSUnresolvedError`. It does not run a backup prime search.

## Stage 2: Search Interval

The search interval is the finite interval to the right of `p` inspected by the PGS
selector.

Inside the search interval, the generator uses:

- offsets from the input prime;
- wheel-open positions;
- exact divisor-count state;
- GWR-selected integer structure;
- no-later-simpler-composite ceilings;
- search-interval-reset next-prime state.

The search interval is not a place to ask a primality oracle which number is prime. It
is the local arithmetic region where the PGS rule decides the next prime.

## Stage 3: Integer

GWR identifies the simplest leftmost integer `w` inside the search interval.

The integer is not the endpoint. It is a landmark that orients the local PGS
state. The rule `q = w + 1` is false as a general rule and is forbidden.

## Stage 4: Endpoint Rule

The production next-prime selection rule is Rule X with search-interval reset:

- build wheel-open candidate next-prime hypotheses;
- reject candidates with composite divisor-count state;
- preserve semiprime-shadow landmarks as unresolved landmarks instead of
  promoting them to endpoint survivors;
- lock the GWR-selected integer only after a resolved survivor exists;
- apply the lower-divisor threat ceiling after integer lock;
- identify the first resolved survivor `r`;
- reset the search interval at `r`;
- classify later unresolved candidates as post-reset search interval material;
- output `r` as the proposed next prime.

In compact form:

$$q = B(p, S, w, d(w))$$

where `S` is the exact divisor-count search-interval state needed to make the endpoint
choice single-valued.

## Stage 5: Output

For each resolved input prime `p`, the generator outputs exactly one line:

```json
{"p": 11, "q": 13}
```

The line contains no extra keys. It contains no selected-integer data, relation
history, proof object, approval flags, counters, status categories, source
labels, or hidden diagnostics.

The generator script contains generation logic only. It does not contain
artifact writing, audit, reporting, command-line orchestration, fallback prime
search, trial division, or downstream validation helpers.

Sidecar diagnostics are produced by the controller, not by the outputted stream.
The current production generator source is always `PGS` when a record is
outputted.

## Validation Surfaces

Low exact production surfaces:

```text
11..1000      input primes 164     PGS 164     failures 0
11..10000     input primes 1225    PGS 1225    failures 0
11..100000    input primes 9588    PGS 9588    failures 0
11..1000000   input primes 78494   PGS 78494   failures 0
```

High-scale decade-window surface:

```text
surface: 256 consecutive input primes per decade, 10^8 through 10^18
candidate_bound: 1024
input primes tested: 2816
PGS outputs: 2816
audit failures: 0
```

## Forbidden Generator Tools

Generation must not call or contain:

- trial division;
- fallback prime search;
- `isPrime`;
- Miller-Rabin;
- `nextprime`;
- probabilistic primality tests;
- ECPP;
- PARI primality checks;
- sieve-based prime generation.

Downstream audit may use classical validation after generation. Audit code must
not live in the generator file and must not choose `q` inside generation.

## Completion Standard

A complete PGS-only generator satisfies these conditions on a declared surface:

- every input prime on the surface outputs exactly one record;
- every outputted `q` is the actual next prime after `p`;
- every record has exactly `p` and `q`;
- no forbidden tool is used inside generation;
- unresolved cases fail explicitly with `PGSUnresolvedError`;
- downstream audit checks the outputted records after generation.
