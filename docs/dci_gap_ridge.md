# DNI Gap Ridge

Prime gaps have interior composite points.

That is the observable setting for this concern. Between one prime and the next, every interior integer is composite. Once the **Divisor Normalization Identity** (DNI) \(Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}\) is evaluated exactly on those interiors, the question is no longer whether composites lie inside the gap. The question is where the strongest raw composite `Z` value tends to sit inside that gap.

The current repository result is that the strongest raw composite `Z` value is not usually centered. It forms a near-edge ridge.

Up to `10^6` on the natural number line:

- the gap-local raw-`Z` maximum lands at edge distance `2` in `43.6006%` of tested gaps versus an exact within-gap baseline of `22.1859%`,
- the resulting edge-distance enrichment is `1.965x`,
- the gap-local raw-`Z` maximum is carried by a `d(n) = 4` composite in `82.9027%` of tested gaps versus an exact within-gap baseline of `20.1401%`,
- the resulting carrier enrichment is `4.116x`.

This is the gap-ridge concern of the DNI. It is the study of where the strongest exact raw composite `Z` value appears inside prime gaps and what kind of composite carries that peak.

## What Is Being Measured

The field under study is the exact raw DNI field itself,

$$
Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2},
$$

restricted to composite interiors of prime gaps.

For each consecutive prime gap \(p < q\) with interior composites, the study evaluates the raw composite `Z` value at every interior point and selects the single interior composite with the largest value. That point is the gap-local peak.

Two measurements then matter:

- how far that peak sits from the nearest edge of the gap,
- which divisor count carries that peak.

The edge-distance question tells us whether the field rises toward the boundary or toward the midpoint. The carrier question tells us which divisor class most often supports the peak. In the current exact runs, the answers are near-edge position and `d(n) = 4` carrier dominance.

## Why This Is A Separate Concern

The gap-ridge result is not the same concern as the production prefilter.

The prefilter concern asks how the fixed-point locus is used operationally to remove composite work before Miller-Rabin. The gap-ridge concern asks what structure the exact raw composite field shows inside prime gaps once exact divisor count is available.

It is also narrower than the full exact raw composite field concern. The broader field concern studies the exact raw composite `Z` field itself. The gap-ridge concern studies one specific structure within that field: the location and carrier of the within-gap maximum.

## Exact Method

The method in this repository is deterministic and exact.

1. Fix one natural-number regime.
2. Compute exact divisor count `d(n)` on that interval.
3. Identify every consecutive prime gap `p < q` with `q - p >= 4`.
4. Restrict attention to the composite interior points `p < n < q`.
5. Evaluate the raw DNI field `Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}` on those interiors.
6. Within each gap, select the single composite with the largest raw `Z`.
7. Compare the observed peak position and observed peak carrier against exact within-gap baselines induced by the same interior.

The implementation compares peak candidates through the monotone identity

$$
\ln Z(n) = \left(1 - \frac{d(n)}{2}\right)\ln n
$$

only to preserve the ordering of the exact same raw field without floating-point underflow. The quantity being studied remains raw `Z`.

In the normative Python helpers for this concern, exact divisor counts over intervals are supplied by the exact composite-field path, and the gap-ridge summaries are produced by [src/python/geodesic_prime_gap_ridge/runs.py](../src/python/geodesic_prime_gap_ridge/runs.py).

## Exact `10^6` Result

The first full exact result in the repository is the natural-number run up to `10^6`.

`N = 1,000,000`

Prime gaps tested: `70,327`

| Metric | Observed | Exact baseline | Enrichment |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Gap-local max at edge distance `2` | `43.6006%` | `22.1859%` | `1.965x` |
| Mean edge distance of gap-local max | `2.9283` | `3.7792` | `1.291x` closer to edge |
| Gap-local max within edge distance `<= 2` | `58.8025%` | `48.2313%` | `1.219x` |
| Gap-local max carried by `d(n) = 4` | `82.9027%` | `20.1401%` | `4.116x` |

Additional structure from the same run sharpens the picture:

- left edge wins in `74.5574%` of gaps,
- right edge wins in `16.0180%` of gaps,
- exact center wins in `9.4245%` of gaps.

The strongest supported reading of this table is that the raw composite field does not build a midpoint ridge. It builds a near-edge low-divisor ridge, and that ridge is carried predominantly by `d(n) = 4` composites.

## Lexicographic Peak Rule

The current repository surface now supports a stronger empirical statement
about how that ridge is selected.

Across the tested regimes, the exact raw-`Z` peak inside each prime gap matches
the lexicographic winner:

1. choose the smallest interior divisor count `d(n)`,
2. if several interior composites share that minimum divisor count, choose the
   leftmost one.

This was validated directly by a counterexample search over exact `10^6`, exact
`10^7`, and sampled larger-scale regimes through `10^10`, with zero
counterexamples on the tested surface.

That does not turn the current result into a proof for all gaps. It does change
the current best explanation of the measured ridge: on the tested surface, the
observed near-edge low-divisor ridge is realized exactly through this discrete
ordering law.

## Gap-Size Structure

The edge effect is present across gap sizes, but its expression changes by regime.

In the exact `10^6` run:

- gaps `4-10` show edge-distance-`2` share `51.1269%` and `d(n) = 4` carrier share `66.1648%`,
- gaps `12-20` show edge-distance-`2` share `38.9273%` and `d(n) = 4` carrier share `98.5198%`,
- gaps `22+` show edge-distance-`2` share `32.2688%` and `d(n) = 4` carrier share `99.4616%`.

The near-edge location softens as gaps widen, but the low-divisor carrier pattern strengthens. That is why the ridge is best described by two linked properties rather than by one alone:

- peak mass sits unusually close to the edge,
- the peak carrier is unusually often a `d(n) = 4` composite.

## Regime Confirmation

The repository also includes broader regime confirmation through larger-scale windowed runs.

Across the tested regimes summarized in the current figure note:

- edge-distance-`2` enrichment stays near `2x` from the exact `10^6` run through sampled `10^10` windows,
- the `d(n) = 4` carrier enrichment strengthens with scale, rising from `4.116x` at `10^6` to about `5.76x` in even-window `10^10` runs and about `5.93x` in fixed-seed `10^10` runs,
- the left edge remains the dominant side of the ridge throughout the tested regimes.

This does not widen the claim beyond the current repository surface. It says that the near-edge ridge pattern seen in the exact `10^6` run continues to appear in the larger tested windows already committed to the figure note.

## Reproduction Surface

To reproduce the exact `10^6` gap-edge study, run:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/python/gap_ridge/raw_z_gap_edge_study.py
```

To reproduce the broader rendered regime surface, run:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/python/gap_ridge/raw_z_gap_edge_run_all.py \
  > benchmarks/output/python/gap_ridge/raw_z_gap_edge/raw_z_gap_edge_run_all.json

python3 benchmarks/python/gap_ridge/raw_z_gap_edge_plots.py
```

Those artifacts keep this concern auditable from exact interval computation, to gap-local peak selection, to measured enrichment tables and figures.
