# Single-Hole Search-Interval Closure

The single-hole probe found legal closure candidates for every one-hole
unresolved true-next-prime case on the tested surface.

Result:

- `single_hole_case_count: 178`
- `single_hole_closure_candidate_count: 178`
- `true_boundary_rejected_count: 0`

Next-Prime Law 005 is not approved by this note.

## Objective

The composite-exclusion unresolved forensics found `230` cases where the true
endpoint remained `UNRESOLVED`. In `178` of those cases, the true-next-prime
candidate had exactly one unresolved wheel-open interior offset.

This probe asks whether that one hole has a legal closure candidate.

It does not emit primes. It does not add the rule to the generator. It records
closure evidence for the one-hole cases and leaves integration to a later
ablation step.

## Instrument

Script:

- `benchmarks/python/prime_inference_generator/single_hole_closure_probe.py`

Artifacts:

- `single_hole_closure_probe_records.jsonl`
- `single_hole_closure_probe_summary.json`

Each case records:

- `anchor_p`
- `actual_boundary_offset_label`
- `unresolved_open_offset`
- `unresolved_open_n`
- `resolved_survivor_offset`
- `candidate_chamber_width`
- `known_composite_witnesses_before_hole`
- `known_composite_witnesses_after_hole`
- `gwr_carrier_w`
- `gwr_carrier_offset`
- `gwr_carrier_divisor_count`
- `hole_relative_to_carrier`
- `hole_wheel_residue`
- `hole_square_status`
- `hole_power_status`
- `hole_small_factor_witness_status`
- `hole_semiprime_pressure`
- `hole_higher_divisor_pressure`
- `candidate_missing_rule`

## Closure Candidates

The probe tests only positive closure evidence:

1. `power_closure`
   - The hole is a perfect square, cube, or higher integer power.
2. `small_factor_positive_witness_closure`
   - The hole has a concrete bounded factor witness from the extended witness
     set.

The active eliminator uses witnesses:

- `7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31`

The single-hole probe tests additional positive witness factors:

- `37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97`

This is still positive composite evidence. Absence of a witness is not used as
primality evidence.

Offline exact factorization fields are included only as diagnostics for
semiprime and higher-divisor pressure. They are not closure rules.

## Interpretation

The one-hole failure mode is not mathematically scattered.

Every one-hole true-next-prime case is closable by a positive bounded witness
extension through `97`. The `13` power cases are a subset of those closures.
The exact offline diagnostics show the holes are:

- semiprimes with divisor count `4`, or
- prime squares with divisor count `3`.

This does not make the current generator emit. It identifies the next safe
rule-family candidate:

- extend positive composite witnesses for unresolved interior holes.

The rule must still be tested inside the composite-exclusion eliminator with
ablation. The safety gate remains:

- `true_boundary_rejected_count == 0`

## Status

Milestone 1 remains blocked.

Next-Prime Law 005 is not approved.

The next admissible implementation is an ablation run that incorporates this
closure rule into the eliminator and measures whether:

- `true_boundary_unresolved_count` decreases;
- `unique_resolved_survivor_count` increases;
- `true_boundary_rejected_count` remains `0`.

## Integrated Ablation Result

The closure rule was integrated into the composite-exclusion probe behind an
explicit flag:

- `--enable-single-hole-positive-witness-closure`
- `--witness-bound 97`

Surface:

- input primes: `11..10_000`
- candidate bound: `64`

Before closure:

- `true_boundary_status_counts: {RESOLVED_SURVIVOR: 995, UNRESOLVED: 230}`
- `unique_resolved_survivor_count: 0`
- `average_unresolved_count: 8.406530612244898`
- `average_resolved_survivor_count: 1.0`

After closure:

- `true_boundary_rejected_count: 0`
- `true_boundary_status_counts: {RESOLVED_SURVIVOR: 1173, UNRESOLVED: 52}`
- `unique_resolved_survivor_count: 0`
- `average_unresolved_count: 8.218775510204082`
- `average_resolved_survivor_count: 1.1877551020408164`

Rule attribution:

- `single_hole_positive_witness_closure_applied_count: 230`
- `single_hole_positive_witness_true_boundary_closures: 178`
- `single_hole_positive_witness_false_boundary_closures: 52`
- `power_closure_subset_count: 13`

The integration produced a real completion gain without violating the safety
gate:

- the true-next-prime unresolved count fell from `230` to `52`;
- true-next-prime rejection stayed at `0`.

It did not create unique resolved next prime certificates. Because `52`
false-endpoint alternatives were also closed, the eliminator still has
unresolved or competing alternatives and remains fail-closed.
