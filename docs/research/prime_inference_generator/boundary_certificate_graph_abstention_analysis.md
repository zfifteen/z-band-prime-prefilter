# Boundary Certificate Graph Abstention Analysis

## Status

This is offline graph-solver analysis. It is not pure production emission and
does not approve cryptographic use.

Boundary Law 005 remains candidate-grade. Boundary Law 005B remains
quarantined. Classical labels are used only after the graph solver has already
produced its graph state, and only for reporting.

## Purpose

Boundary Certificate Graph Solver v0 safely emitted 36 experimental graph
certificates on anchors `11..10_000`, but did not improve coverage beyond the
005A-R emitter. The abstention analysis identified why the solver stopped and
which graph relation should be added next.

The accepted v0 graph rules are:

- positive composite witness rejection;
- single-hole positive witness closure;
- carrier-locked pressure ceiling;
- 005A-R higher-divisor locked absorption.

The analysis does not add 005B, broad resolved-chamber absorption,
earliest-candidate dominance, scalar ranking, or any new emission path.

## Target Run

The v0 abstention run showed:

```text
anchor_range: 11..10000
candidate_bound: 128
witness_bound: 127
anchors_evaluated: 1225
graph_solved_count: 36
graph_abstain_count: 1189
graph_confirmed_count: 36
graph_failed_count: 0
```

## Dominant Abstention Structure

The graph solver usually has already resolved the true boundary, but it cannot
emit because later unresolved alternatives remain live.

```text
TRUE_BOUNDARY_RESOLVED_BUT_UNRESOLVED_LATER_REMAIN: 1137
TRUE_BOUNDARY_UNRESOLVED: 52
```

The true-boundary status split is:

```text
RESOLVED: 1137
UNRESOLVED: 52
REJECTED: 0
ABSORBED: 0
NOT_IN_CANDIDATE_SET: 0
```

No true boundary was rejected or absorbed by the accepted v0 graph rules.

## Missing Relation Patterns

The primary missing relation pattern counts are:

```text
NEED_UNRESOLVED_LATER_DOMINATION: 1137
NEED_TRUE_BOUNDARY_CLOSURE: 52
```

The dominant pattern is:

```text
NEED_UNRESOLVED_LATER_DOMINATION
```

The recommended next relation is:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_from_existing_graph_facts
```

## v1 Follow-Up

The recommended relation was added as a single label-free graph relation. On
the same surface, the solver moved from 36 solved graphs to 42 solved graphs
with zero audit failures.

```text
graph_solved_count: 42
graph_abstain_count: 1183
graph_confirmed_count: 42
graph_failed_count: 0
```

The remaining abstention split is:

```text
TRUE_BOUNDARY_RESOLVED_BUT_UNRESOLVED_LATER_REMAIN: 1131
TRUE_BOUNDARY_UNRESOLVED: 52
```

The dominant missing pattern remains:

```text
NEED_UNRESOLVED_LATER_DOMINATION
```

## v2 Follow-Up

The v2 refinement kept the same unresolved-later domination family and changed
only the reset-evidence lens. It evaluates reset evidence over the active
candidate graph after rejected and absorbed nodes have been removed, while
still requiring carrier preservation and abstaining on positive or unknown
reset evidence.

```text
graph_solved_count: 130
graph_abstain_count: 1095
graph_confirmed_count: 130
graph_failed_count: 0
v2_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 88
v2_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
```

The remaining abstention split is:

```text
TRUE_BOUNDARY_RESOLVED_BUT_UNRESOLVED_LATER_REMAIN: 1040
TRUE_BOUNDARY_RESOLVED_WITH_MULTIPLE_RESOLVED_SURVIVORS: 3
TRUE_BOUNDARY_UNRESOLVED: 52
```

The dominant missing pattern remains unresolved-later domination, but the
v2 result shows that active-graph reset awareness is the right refinement path.

## Interpretation

The main blocker is not false resolved survivors and not candidate-bound
coverage. The graph already contains the actual boundary as a resolved
candidate in most abstentions. It abstains because unresolved candidates after
that resolved boundary remain live.

The graph still needs a stronger unresolved-later domination discriminator.
The v1 and v2 relations prove that this path can increase coverage, but most
later unresolved alternatives remain live. Any next relation must stay
label-free and must not become broad resolved-chamber absorption.

## Next Implementation Step

The next refinement should stay in this family:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_from_existing_graph_facts_v3
```

Before integration, define the refinement as a label-free predicate over graph
facts, then test whether it increases `graph_solved_count` above 130 with:

```text
graph_failed_count: 0
true_boundary_rejected_or_absorbed: 0
```

If no label-free discriminator can be found, the relation should abstain rather
than absorb.
