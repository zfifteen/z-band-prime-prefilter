# Candidate-Constraint Graph Solver

## Status

The candidate-constraint graph solver is an offline experimental inference
artifact. It is not production pure emission. It does not approve
cryptographic use. Classical validation remains a separate downstream audit
over records that have already been emitted.

Next-Prime Law 005 remains candidate-grade. The only live rule family used here
is 005A-R. Next-Prime Law 005B remains quarantined.

Graph v6 is the active safe solver version. It is v3 plus one repaired
no-selected-integer relation with positive target non-endpoint evidence. Graph v4 and
v5 remain quarantined outside the last clean `11..10_000` development surface
because v4 absorbed the unresolved true next prime at input prime `10193` during the
`11..100_000` scale run.

## Purpose

The previous emitter produced inferred-prime records from a single refined
activation rule. The graph solver keeps the same accepted rule set but changes
the implementation shape:

1. build candidate next prime nodes for an input prime;
2. attach accepted PGS facts to each node;
3. attach rule relations between nodes;
4. propagate accepted eliminations until stable;
5. emit only when one resolved candidate remains and no unresolved alternatives
   remain.

The solver asks whether the existing PGS facts already force a endpoint when
they are composed as a small deduction graph.

## Accepted Rule Families

The graph uses only rule families already admitted into the experimental
pipeline:

- positive composite witness rejection;
- single-hole positive witness closure;
- selected-integer-locked pressure ceiling;
- 005A-R higher-divisor locked absorption with
  `single_hole_closure_used = false`.
- unresolved-later domination from existing graph facts.
- repaired no-selected-integer target domination with positive non-endpoint evidence.

It does not use 005B, broad resolved-interval absorption, earliest-candidate
dominance, scalar ranking, prime-marker identity, `nextprime`, `isprime`, or
classical labels during solving.

## v1 Relation

The v1 addition was one relation:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_from_existing_graph_facts
```

It absorbs only the nearest later unresolved candidate after a resolved source
when the source has no single-hole closure dependency, the target search interval
preserves the same first legal integer, and the existing graph facts contain no
same-or-lower divisor reset evidence between the source and target.

The relation abstains when reset evidence is positive or unknown. It does not
use labels, candidate ranking, 005B, or broad resolved-interval absorption.

## v2 Relation

The v2 refinement stays inside the same relation family:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_from_existing_graph_facts_v2
```

It keeps the resolved-source, nearest-later-unresolved, no-single-hole, and
integer-preservation requirements. The controlled expansion is the reset
check: v2 computes reset evidence over the active candidate graph after
rejected and absorbed nodes have been removed. It still abstains when the active
graph contains positive reset evidence or when the reset state is unknown.

This is not broad resolved-interval absorption. It is a reset-aware active-graph
refinement of unresolved-later domination.

## v3 Relation

The v3 refinement remains inside the same relation family:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_from_existing_graph_facts_v3
```

It targets active graphs with exactly one resolved survivor. If that resolved
source has no legal integer, no single-hole closure dependency, and the
nearest later unresolved candidate has a first legal integer after the source,
v3 absorbs that nearest later unresolved candidate. It then repeats on the
active graph.

This relation does not say there is no reset in the number-theoretic sense. It
says the existing active graph has one resolved source, that source is an
empty-selected-integer search interval, and the next unresolved extension has a positive integer
fact after the source. The single-resolved-source guard is load-bearing; a
broader empty-selected-integer version absorbed true next primes in abstaining
multiple-resolved graphs during development and was not retained.

## Quarantined v4 Relation

The quarantined v4 refinement added one relation inside unresolved-later
domination:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_target_no_carrier_reset_discriminator
```

It acts only when the active graph has exactly one resolved survivor, that
source has no single-hole closure dependency, and the target is the nearest
later unresolved candidate. The target must have no legal integer under the
current witness bound. The active graph between source and target must contain
no positive reset evidence.

This relation does not claim a universal absence of reset. It records that the
existing active graph has no positive reset evidence for the nearest
no-selected-integer unresolved target. It abstains on multiple resolved survivors,
single-hole-dependent sources, targets with legal integers, positive reset
evidence, and unknown preconditions.

The relation is quarantined because the `11..100_000` scale run found input prime
`10193`, where offset `18` is the true next prime and remained unresolved through
v3. The v4 absence-based no-selected-integer relation absorbed that target. The failure
was reproduced in a single-input prime audit and classified as an unsafe relation,
not a mutation-order, range-order, or audit bug.

## Quarantined v5 Relation

The quarantined v5 refinement stayed inside unresolved-later domination:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_post_v4_empty_source_carrier_extension
```

It is a post-v4 re-evaluation of the v3 empty-source extension pattern. v4
removes nearest unresolved targets that have no legal integer and no positive
active reset evidence. After those blockers are removed, v5 checks the active
graph again. It acts only when exactly one resolved survivor remains, that
source has no legal integer, the source has no single-hole closure dependency,
and the nearest later unresolved candidate has its first legal integer after
the source.

This relation does not add broad resolved-interval absorption. It acts only on
the nearest later unresolved candidate and repeats on the active graph.

Graph v5 inherits the v4 failure because it depends on the v4 no-selected-integer
removals. It is not part of the active v6 solver.

## v6 Relation

Graph v6 does not restore v4 or v5. It is v3 plus one repaired relation:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_target_no_carrier_with_positive_nonboundary_guard
```

The repaired relation acts only when all of these graph facts are present:

- the active graph has exactly one resolved survivor;
- the source is that resolved survivor;
- the source has no single-hole closure dependency;
- the target is the nearest later unresolved candidate;
- the target has no legal integer under the current witness bound;
- the active graph contains no positive reset evidence between source and
  target;
- the target has positive non-endpoint evidence.

The positive non-endpoint evidence is label-free. It may come from a bounded
composite witness, power witness, certified divisor-class certificate,
wheel-closed target, independently rejected target, or target position beyond
a selected selected-integer-locked pressure ceiling.

The relation abstains when the target has no positive non-endpoint evidence.
This is the safety correction from the v4 failure: absence of reset evidence
alone is not enough to absorb a no-selected-integer unresolved target.

## Record Contract

Each emitted JSONL record uses:

- `record_type: PGS_INFERRED_PRIME_EXPERIMENTAL_GRAPH`
- `inference_status: INFERRED_BY_BOUNDARY_CERTIFICATE_GRAPH_V6`
- `production_approved: false`
- `cryptographic_use_approved: false`
- `classical_audit_required: true`
- `classical_audit_status: NOT_RUN`

The inferred value is emitted as an experimental graph certificate. It is not a
production prime-generation result.

## Audit Endpoint

The solver writes graph records without classical validation. The audit mode
reads the emitted JSONL later and confirms whether `inferred_prime_q_hat` is
the first classical prime after `anchor_p`.

Classical validation is therefore downstream evidence, not a rule input.

## v0 Result

On input primes `11..10_000` with `candidate_bound = 128` and
`witness_bound = 127`, v0 emitted 36 experimental graph records.

Separate downstream audit confirmed 36/36 records with 0 failures.

This was safe but not a coverage breakthrough. Under the accepted v0 rule set,
the graph solver was operationally equivalent to the 005A-R emitter on this
surface.

## v1 Target

- input primes `11..10_000`;
- `candidate_bound = 128`;
- `witness_bound = 127`;
- rule set `005A-R` plus the single unresolved-later domination relation.

## v1 Result

```text
graph_solved_count: 42
graph_abstain_count: 1183
new_relation_applied_count: 169
new_relation_solution_count: 6
```

Separate downstream audit:

```text
audited_count: 42
confirmed_count: 42
failed_count: 0
new_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 6
new_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
```

This is the first graph-solver coverage improvement beyond the 36-record
005A-R island while keeping downstream audit failures at zero.

## v2 Result

On the same surface:

```text
graph_solved_count: 130
graph_abstain_count: 1095
new_relation_applied_count: 1181
new_relation_solution_count: 94
v1_relation_applied_count: 169

```

Separate downstream audit:

```text

new_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
v2_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 88
v2_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
```

This is a generator-facing coverage gain from 42 to 130 solved graph records
without any downstream audit failures.

v2_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
v3_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 81

```

The follow-up abstention analysis found no true-next-prime rejection or
absorption in the remaining graph states:

```text
true_boundary_status_counts:
  RESOLVED: 962
  UNRESOLVED: 52
  REJECTED: 0
  ABSORBED: 0
  NOT_IN_CANDIDATE_SET: 0
```

Graph v3 is the first solver version to exceed 200 emitted experimental graph
records on input primes `11..10_000` while preserving zero downstream audit
failures on the tested surface.

## v4 Result

On the same surface:

```text
graph_solved_count: 447

```

Separate downstream audit:

```text
audited_count: 447

first_failure: null
new_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 411
new_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0

```

The follow-up abstention analysis found no true-next-prime rejection or
absorption in the remaining graph states:

  RESOLVED: 726
  UNRESOLVED: 52
  REJECTED: 0

  NOT_IN_CANDIDATE_SET: 0
```

Graph v4 increases experimental graph emissions from 211 to 447 on input primes
`11..10_000` with zero downstream audit failures on the tested surface.

## v5 Result

On the same surface:

```text
graph_solved_count: 995
graph_abstain_count: 230
new_relation_applied_count: 15380
new_relation_solution_count: 959

```

Separate downstream audit:

```text

first_failure: null
new_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 959
new_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
v5_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 548
v5_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
```

The follow-up abstention analysis found no true-next-prime rejection or
absorption in the remaining graph states:

```text
true_boundary_status_counts:
  RESOLVED: 178
  UNRESOLVED: 52
  REJECTED: 0
  ABSORBED: 0
  NOT_IN_CANDIDATE_SET: 0
```

Graph v5 increases experimental graph emissions from 447 to 995 on input primes
`11..10_000` with zero downstream audit failures on the tested surface.

## v4/v5 Scale Failure

The `11..100_000` scale run exposed a v4 failure:

```text
input_prime_p: 10193
bad emitted q_hat: 10201
actual next prime: 10211
bad emitted offset: 8
actual next prime offset: 18
relation_that_absorbed_true_boundary: v4
```

The audit confirmed first-endpoint semantics, not mere primality. The true
endpoint was in the candidate set, remained unresolved through v3, and was
absorbed by v4. Therefore v4 and v5 are quarantined outside the last clean
`11..10_000` surface.

## v6 Integration Result

Graph v6 integrates only the repaired v4 candidate. It does not call the old
v4 or v5 propagation relations.

Configuration:

```text
candidate_bound: 128
witness_bound: 127
```

On input primes `11..10_000`:

```text
graph_solved_count: 212
graph_abstain_count: 1013
audited_count: 212
confirmed_count: 212
failed_count: 0
v4_relation_applied_count: 0
v5_relation_applied_count: 0
repaired_relation_applied_count: 64
repaired_relation_solution_count: 1
repaired_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 1
repaired_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
```

On input primes `11..100_000`:

```text
graph_solved_count: 217
graph_abstain_count: 9371
audited_count: 217
confirmed_count: 217
failed_count: 0
v4_relation_applied_count: 0
v5_relation_applied_count: 0
repaired_relation_applied_count: 83
repaired_relation_solution_count: 1
repaired_relation_correct_count_after_audit: 1
repaired_relation_wrong_count_after_audit: 0
```

Graph v6 is a safe repair over v3 on these surfaces. It is not a restoration
of the v4/v5 coverage jump.

## Failure Handling

Any audit failure is research evidence and must be recorded directly. It is not
a hidden error to patch around. A failed graph emission blocks the corresponding
rule composition from generator eligibility until the failure has a structural
explanation and the full matrix is rerun.
