# Boundary Law 004: First Boundary-Forcing Predicate

Boundary Laws 001 through 003 tested chamber certification. They did not produce
a lawful emission because chamber consistency is not boundary force. Boundary
Law 004 changes the target: identify a predicate that makes the chamber stop.

This note surveys candidate boundary-forcing predicates under the pure
generation contract. It does not emit. Its status is
`BOUNDARY_FORCING_REQUIRES_NEW_THEOREM`.

## Name

First Boundary-Forcing Predicate.

The law asks for a deterministic PGS predicate that takes anchor and chamber
state and returns a unique `q_hat` without primality testing, next-prime lookup,
or boundary discovery by scanning to `d(n) = 2`.

## Required Predicate Contract

A boundary-forcing predicate must:

- start from an externally supplied anchor prime `p`;
- use only PGS-computable chamber state;
- identify a unique boundary offset;
- distinguish a forced boundary from an admissible candidate;
- fail closed when the boundary is not unique;
- emit enough metadata to reproduce the inference.

It must not assume the proposed chamber boundary and then merely verify that the
interior is coherent.

## Forbidden Mechanisms

Boundary Law 004 rejects any predicate that emits because:

- the boundary is classically known;
- the candidate is first wheel-open;
- the proposed chamber is internally coherent;
- there is no smaller boundary candidate inside the assumed chamber;
- the old recursive walker finds the boundary;
- a scan reaches `d(n) = 2`;
- trial division, sieve generation, Miller-Rabin, `isprime`, or `nextprime`
  identifies the boundary.

The standard is unchanged: PGS must force `q_hat`; audit only confirms
afterward.

## Candidate 1: First Post-Carrier Admissible Closure

Statement:

After a GWR carrier is established, the first admissible open offset satisfying
local closure constraints is forced as the right boundary.

Anchor-13 probe:

- carrier: `w = 14`;
- divisor class: `d(w) = 4`;
- later proposed interior points: `15`, `16`;
- first post-chamber open candidate: `17`.

What it establishes:

- the chamber has a carrier;
- no smaller boundary inside the proposed chamber survives;
- local interior closure is coherent.

What remains missing:

- a proof that the first admissible post-carrier closure point must be the
  boundary;
- a rule that distinguishes first admissible post-carrier candidate from a
  later boundary without checking primality.

Status:

`FAILED_CLOSED`

Failure reason:

`FIRST_POST_CARRIER_ADMISSIBILITY_NOT_FORCE`

## Candidate 2: Threat-Margin Closure

Statement:

The boundary must occur before the first later lower-divisor threat overtakes
the GWR winner.

For a winner `w`, define:

$$T_{<}(w) = \min \{m > w : d(m) < d(w)\}$$

The closure condition is:

$$q < T_{<}(w)$$

What it establishes:

- a valid upper constraint on the boundary when `T_{<}(w)` is known;
- a no-later-simpler interval in which the boundary must lie;
- a useful threat margin after a proposed `q_hat` is known.

What remains missing:

- a unique boundary point inside the interval;
- a way to compute the boundary without searching for primality;
- a reason that one admissible point in the interval is forced over another.

Status:

`FAILED_CLOSED`

Failure reason:

`THREAT_MARGIN_BOUNDS_INTERVAL_NOT_POINT`

## Candidate 3: DNI Fixed-Point Boundary

Statement:

A boundary occurs where the normalized chamber transition reaches the prime
fixed-point locus, without classical primality testing.

The desired predicate would map chamber state to a unique offset:

$$B(p, S, w, d(w)) = q_{hat}$$

where `S` is the PGS state and `w` is the active carrier.

What it establishes:

- a plausible form for a true boundary-forcing law;
- a direct path from normalized chamber state to boundary emission if solved.

What remains missing:

- the actual invariant equation or transition law that returns one offset;
- proof that the returned offset is unique;
- a worked anchor where the returned offset is derived without using a known
  prime boundary.

Status:

`BOUNDARY_FORCING_REQUIRES_NEW_THEOREM`

Failure reason:

`NO_DNI_FIXED_POINT_BOUNDARY_MAP`

## Candidate 4: Recursive Witness Closure

Statement:

Once `d_min` and carrier offset are known, a deterministic witness map returns a
boundary candidate without calling `nextprime`.

What it establishes:

- a possible implementation shape for a pure boundary selector;
- a route from interior carrier metadata to a boundary offset.

What remains missing:

- a witness map that is not trained on, derived from, or validated inline by
  classical boundary discovery;
- a proof that the witness map returns a unique boundary;
- evidence that the map is not only replaying known prime gaps.

Status:

`FAILED_CLOSED`

Failure reason:

`NO_PURE_RECURSIVE_WITNESS_MAP`

## Candidate 5: Finite-State Transition Law

Statement:

A reduced gap-type or chamber-state engine predicts the next boundary offset
from state transitions rather than primality detection.

What it establishes:

- a possible compressed symbolic route to boundary inference;
- a natural place to encode recurring GWR/DNI chamber regimes.

What remains missing:

- a finite state whose transition output is a boundary offset, not just a gap
  type or consistency label;
- exact recovery without classical feedback during generation;
- a proof that the state transition is deterministic and unique for the active
  chamber.

Status:

`FAILED_CLOSED`

Failure reason:

`FINITE_STATE_BOUNDARY_OUTPUT_UNPROVED`

## Current Result

No candidate predicate in this note currently forces a boundary.

The strongest supported result is:

PGS chamber certificates can establish interior closure, GWR winners,
leftmost-minimum carriers, and local no-later-simpler consistency. They do not
yet imply a unique next boundary.

Status:

`BOUNDARY_FORCING_REQUIRES_NEW_THEOREM`

## Missing Theorem

The missing theorem is a boundary-forcing theorem external to chamber
certification:

$$\text{PGS chamber state} \Rightarrow \text{unique right boundary offset}$$

For a carrier-bearing chamber, the desired form is:

$$B(p, S, w, d(w)) = q_{hat}$$

where `B` is deterministic, non-classical, and fails when the state is
ambiguous.

## Emission Rule

Pure mode may emit under `boundary_law_004` only if one candidate predicate is
upgraded from a certificate or bound into a unique boundary map.

Until then, pure mode must emit:

- `rule_set_version: "boundary_law_004"`
- `inference_status: "failed_closed"`
- `failure_reason: "BOUNDARY_FORCING_REQUIRES_NEW_THEOREM"`

## Next Search Direction

The next research task is not another small chamber certificate. It is to search
for the missing function:

$$B(p, S, w, d(w))$$

The most promising paths are:

- derive a DNI fixed-point boundary map;
- find a pure recursive witness map that is not classical boundary discovery;
- prove a finite-state transition law that outputs boundary offsets exactly.

If none of these closes, the result is still clean: GWR/DNI currently describes
and constrains proposed chambers, but a separate boundary-forcing theorem is
needed before pure prime inference can emit.
