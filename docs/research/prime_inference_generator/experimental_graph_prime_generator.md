# Experimental Graph Prime Generator

## Status

The experimental graph prime generator is a generator-facing CLI for PGS graph
inference records. It is not production pure emission. It does not approve
cryptographic use. Classical validation is available only as a downstream
audit over already emitted records.

The default solver mode is `v6`, the safe repaired graph line. The quarantined
high-coverage line is exposed as `risky-v5` so its output and failures can be
measured explicitly. The filtered research line is exposed as `filtered-v5`.
The bounded high-coverage audited line is exposed as `v7-bounded`.

## Command

```text
python3 benchmarks/python/prime_inference_generator/experimental_graph_prime_generator.py \
  --solver-version v6 \
  --start-anchor 11 \
  --max-anchor 100000 \
  --candidate-bound 128 \
  --witness-bound 127 \
  --audit \
  --fail-on-audit-failure \
  --print-dashboard \
  --output-dir output/prime_inference_generator
```

Supported solver versions:

```text
v3
v6
v7-bounded
risky-v5
filtered-v5
```

`v6` is the default.

The quarantined research modes require an explicit acknowledgement:

```text
--allow-research-mode
```

This flag is required for `risky-v5` and `filtered-v5`. It is not required for
`v3` or `v6`.

## Solver Modes

`v3` uses the accepted graph relations through the empty-source legal-carrier
extension relation. It is the broad safe baseline before the repaired v4 guard.

`v6` uses v3 plus:

```text
unresolved_later_domination_target_no_carrier_with_positive_nonboundary_guard
```

This is the safe repaired relation. It requires positive target non-boundary
evidence and does not run the old v4 or v5 absence-based propagation.

`v7-bounded` runs the risky-v5 graph internally, then applies the positive
nonboundary filter with a declared witness horizon. It requires:

```text
--candidate-bound 128
--witness-bound >= 397
--audit
--fail-on-audit-failure
```

On the `11..100_000`, `candidate_bound = 128`, `witness_bound = 397` surface,
it emitted `6039` records, confirmed `6039`, and failed `0` downstream audit
records. It remains non-production and non-cryptographic, but it is the current
highest-coverage zero-failure experimental mode.

`risky-v5` runs the quarantined v5 line. It is exposed only for research
comparison. It includes the old v4 no-carrier/no-active-reset relation that
failed at anchor `10193` on the `11..100_000` surface.

`filtered-v5` runs the same internal risky-v5 solve, then applies a
label-free positive disqualification filter before emitting a record. It does
not emit when `inferred_prime_q_hat` has any of these positive nonboundary
certificates:

- bounded composite witness;
- power witness;
- certified divisor-class nonboundary certificate;
- wheel-closed status.

Filtered candidates are not written as inferred-prime records. They are
counted in the summary with:

```text
filter_status: FILTERED_POSITIVE_NONBOUNDARY_CANDIDATE
```

## Output Records

Each emitted JSONL record uses:

```text
record_type: PGS_INFERRED_PRIME_EXPERIMENTAL_GRAPH
production_approved: false
cryptographic_use_approved: false
audit_required: true
classical_audit_required: true
classical_audit_status: NOT_RUN
```

The inferred value is an experimental graph inference. It is not a production
prime-generation result.

## Summary Fields

The generator summary reports:

```text
solver_version
anchors_scanned
emitted_count
abstained_count
coverage_rate
audit_required
audit_confirmed
audit_failed
first_failure
generator_status
filter_reason_counts
production_approved: false
cryptographic_use_approved: false
```

When `--audit` is supplied, the CLI also writes:

```text
experimental_graph_prime_generator_audit_summary.json
```

The audit checks first-boundary semantics: `inferred_prime_q_hat` must be the
first classical prime after `anchor_p`.

When `--fail-on-audit-failure` is supplied with `--audit`, the CLI still writes
records and summaries, then exits with status `1` if any emitted record fails
downstream audit. This is intended for generator app and CI workflows. It does
not change solver logic and does not move validation into generation.

When `--print-dashboard` is supplied, the CLI prints the same generator-facing
run metrics to stdout:

```text
solver_version
anchors_scanned
emitted_count
abstained_count
coverage_rate
audit_confirmed
audit_failed
first_failure
generator_status
records_path
summary_path
audit_summary_path
```

`generator_status` is the app-facing run state:

```text
AUDIT_NOT_RUN
SAFE_ZERO_FAILURE_AUDITED
BOUNDED_ZERO_FAILURE_AUDITED
RESEARCH_ZERO_FAILURE_AUDITED
AUDIT_FAILED
```

Production approval and cryptographic approval remain `false` for every status.

The generator state is now explicit: v6 is safe and low-coverage on this
surface. v7-bounded is high-coverage and zero-failure under its declared
witness horizon. risky-v5 is high-coverage but fails downstream audit. The
filtered-v5 positive nonboundary filter blocks the known `10193 -> 10201`
square failure and the `10399 -> 10403` bounded semiprime failure at lower
witness horizons. It remains research-only outside the bounded v7 contract.
