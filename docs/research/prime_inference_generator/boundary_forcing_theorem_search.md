# Boundary Forcing Theorem Search

Boundary Laws 001 through 004 isolate the live blocker for the PGS Prime
Inference Generator. The pure scaffold is clean. The chamber certificates are
real. The missing ingredient is a theorem that turns PGS chamber data into a
unique next boundary.

The theorem search target is:

$$PGS\ chamber\ data \Rightarrow unique\ next\ boundary$$

No candidate in this note is installed as a generator rule. The work here is
offline theorem discovery.

## Current Status

Milestone 1 remains blocked.

The strongest supported result is:

PGS chamber certificates can certify interior closure, GWR winners,
leftmost-minimum carriers, and local no-later-simpler consistency. They do not
yet force a unique next boundary.

This means GWR is currently an interior winner law. It is not yet a boundary
generation law.

## Theorem Family 1: First-Open Boundary Theorem

Claim form:

$$closed\ preopen\ chamber \Rightarrow first\ wheel-open\ candidate\ is\ boundary$$

This is the theorem family behind Boundary Law 001 and the empty anchor-11
probe.

Current status:

`FAILED_CLOSED`

Reason:

First wheel-open admissibility identifies a candidate. It does not force that
candidate to be the next boundary.

Kill condition:

Any known anchor where the first wheel-open candidate is composite kills the
unqualified theorem. A surviving version would need additional PGS conditions
that do more than wheel admissibility.

## Theorem Family 2: Carrier-Lock Boundary Theorem

Claim form:

$$GWR\ carrier + no\ later\ lower-divisor\ threat\ up\ to\ candidate\ q \Rightarrow q\ is\ boundary$$

This is the theorem family behind Boundary Law 003 and the anchor-13 carrier
probe.

Current status:

`FAILED_CLOSED`

Reason:

The carrier-lock certificate proves coherence inside a proposed chamber. It
does not prove that the proposed chamber must stop at the candidate boundary.

Kill condition:

Two different admissible candidate boundaries with internally coherent carrier
certificates kill the unqualified theorem. A surviving version must identify
which candidate is forced and why.

## Theorem Family 3: Transition-State Boundary Theorem

Claim form:

$$S(p) \Rightarrow g(p)$$

Here `S(p)` is a PGS state vector computed from allowed local or recursive
structure around anchor `p`, and `g(p)` is the next boundary offset.

This is the most promising family because boundary force may live between
chambers rather than inside one proposed chamber.

Current status:

`OPEN_THEOREM_SEARCH`

Reason:

The right object may be a deterministic transition state, not a self-certifying
chamber. A candidate state vector must map to one next-gap width on tested
surfaces before it can become a theorem candidate.

Kill condition:

The same allowed PGS state mapping to multiple next-boundary offsets kills that
state vector. If all reasonable local state vectors collide, the theorem needs
longer memory, larger deterministic state, or a different invariant.

## Candidate State Ingredients

The transition-state search should test deterministic state vectors built from:

- anchor residue modulo the wheel;
- first-open offset;
- first carrier family;
- first carrier divisor count;
- first carrier offset;
- early divisor ladder shape excluding prime-boundary detection;
- lower-divisor threat schedule;
- previous gap state;
- previous GWR carrier type;
- semiprime-wheel attractor state.

The initial probe should start small. A state collision is not a failure of the
project. It is information about which data cannot force a boundary.

## Legal Ladder State Vectors

The contaminated ladder states use prime-marker masking. The legal ladder search
therefore adds state vectors that do not identify primes:

- `wheel_open_pattern`;
- `open_unknown_ladder`;
- `composite_witness_ladder`;
- `known_composite_divisor_ladder`;
- `carrier_ladder_no_prime_mask`;
- `carrier_plus_open_unknown_ladder`;
- `previous_gap_ladder_no_prime_mask`.

These states encode wheel-open positions as `OPEN_UNKNOWN`. They encode
wheel-closed positions with wheel-basis witness tokens such as `CLOSED_BY_2`.
They use exact divisor-class tokens such as `C5` only when the wheel-basis
factors fully determine the divisor count. They do not mark an offset as prime.

## Offline Probe Contract

The transition-state probe is not the generator. It may use classical labels
because it is theorem discovery.

The probe must:

1. Walk known validated prime gaps on a finite surface.
2. Compute candidate PGS state vectors for each anchor.
3. Attach the classical next gap width as a label.
4. Group rows by state vector.
5. Report collisions where one state maps to multiple boundary offsets.
6. Report the first tested state vector with zero collisions, if one exists.

Output fields:

- `state_vector`
- `row_count`
- `distinct_state_count`
- `collision_count`
- `collision_examples`
- `max_bucket_size`
- `zero_collision`
- `uses_boundary_offset`
- `uses_gap_width`
- `uses_prime_marker_d2`
- `uses_stop_at_first_prime`
- `uses_nextprime_or_isprime`
- `boundary_offset_within_prefix_rate`
- `state_contains_boundary_token_rate`
- `eligible_for_pure_generation`
- `zero_collision_and_eligible`

This does not violate the pure generator contract. It is offline theorem
search. Any candidate found here must still be turned into a pure boundary law
before generation can emit.

## Leakage Audit Gate

Zero collisions are not enough. A state vector is disqualified as a pure
generation candidate if it includes the boundary offset, the current gap width,
prime-marker tokens, stop-at-first-prime behavior, `nextprime`, `isprime`, or an
equivalent boundary-discovery mechanism.

For now, any state vector that uses `d = 2` or a masked prime-position token
inside the prefix is marked:

- `eligible_for_pure_generation: false`

That mark does not make the offline probe invalid. It keeps theorem discovery
separate from lawful generation.

## Current Legal Ladder Result

The first legal ladder expansion tested anchors `11..200`, `11..10_000`, and
`11..100_000` across prefixes `8, 12, 16, 24, 32`.

The contaminated `carrier_ladder` and `previous_gap_ladder` states keep zero
collisions on these surfaces, but they remain ineligible because they use
prime-marker masking.

The legal shadow states do not yet supply a Boundary Law 005 candidate:

- `11..200`, prefix `12`: `known_composite_divisor_ladder` has zero collisions;
- `11..10_000`, all tested prefixes: no eligible zero-collision state;
- `11..100_000`, all tested prefixes: no eligible zero-collision state.

The current result is:

- `first_zero_collision_eligible_state_vector: null`
- Milestone 1 remains blocked.

This indicates that the currently perfect ladder signal depends on illegal
prime-marker information. The legal shadow of that signal has not yet been
found.

## Next Boundary Law Candidate

If the transition-state probe finds a zero-collision state vector on a meaningful
surface, the next candidate is:

Boundary Law 005: Finite Transition Boundary Law.

That law would still need to prove that the state vector is structurally valid
and not just fitted to classical labels.

## Current Conclusion

The next work is theorem discovery, not positive emission.

Milestone 1 remains blocked until the project finds a boundary-forcing theorem:

$$S(p) \Rightarrow g(p)$$

where `S(p)` is non-classical PGS state and `g(p)` is the unique next boundary
offset.
