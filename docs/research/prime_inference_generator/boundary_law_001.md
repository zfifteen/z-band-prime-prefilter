# Next-Prime Law 001: First Open Search-Interval Closure

Next-Prime Law 001 is the first candidate law for Milestone 1 of the PGS Prime
Inference Generator. Its target is deliberately small: produce one lawful
output from input prime `11` without classical primality testing or
next-prime lookup inside the generation loop.

This note is a design note, not a positive result. The law must not be installed
as an outputting rule until the uniqueness condition below is satisfied by PGS
inference rather than by external validation.

## Name

First Open Search-Interval Closure.

The search interval after input prime `11` has one closed integer before the first wheel-open
offset. Next-Prime Law 001 asks whether that first open offset can be inferred as
the right endpoint from PGS search-interval structure alone.

## Allowed Inputs

- `anchor_prime_p = 11`
- deterministic mod-30 wheel residues
- first wheel-open even offset after the input prime
- PGS search-interval metadata derived without primality testing
- rule-set version `boundary_law_001`

For the first input prime:

- `11 mod 30 = 11`
- offset `1` gives `12`, a wheel-closed integer
- offset `2` gives the first wheel-open position

## Forbidden Inputs

The law must not use:

- Miller-Rabin
- `nextprime`
- `isprime`
- `prime`
- `prevprime`
- trial-division primality testing
- sieve-backed divisor counting
- scanning until `d(n) = 2`
- the old recursive predictor
- a committed prime list
- hardcoded output `13`

The law may compute `q_hat = p + first_open_offset` only if the rule has first
established that the first open offset is the unique PGS-inferred next prime for
this search interval.

## Candidate Inference Steps

1. Read input prime `p = 11`.
2. Compute the first wheel-open even offset after `p` under the mod-30 wheel.
3. Record the pre-open interval segment from offsets `1` through
   `first_open_offset - 1`.
4. Verify that every pre-open integer is wheel-closed by deterministic
   divisibility against the wheel basis.
5. Establish that no GWR-selected integer is required when the inferred search interval interior
   contains no admissible open composite integer before the first open offset.
6. Infer `q_hat = p + first_open_offset`.
7. Output `q_hat` only if the next-prime uniqueness condition below is resolved.

## Endpoint Uniqueness Condition

For input prime `11`, the rule must show from PGS search-interval metadata alone that the
first wheel-open position is the right endpoint rather than merely the first
admissible candidate next prime.

The unresolved distinction is:

- candidate statement: the first possible open endpoint after `11` is `11 + 2`;
- next-prime statement: the next prime endpoint inferred by PGS is `11 + 2`.

Next-Prime Law 001 is not accepted as an outputting law until it proves the endpoint
statement without asking whether `11 + 2` is prime.

## Outputted Metadata

If the law resolves the endpoint, pure mode outputs:

- `step_index: 1`
- `anchor_prime_p: 11`
- `inferred_prime_q_hat: 13`
- `inferred_gap_width: 2`
- `winner_carrier_w: null`
- `winner_offset: null`
- `winner_divisor_count: null`
- `winner_family: "empty_pre_open_chamber"`
- `first_open_offset: 2`
- `closure_status: "first_open_boundary_inferred"`
- `threat_margin: null`
- `rule_set_version: "boundary_law_001"`
- `inference_status: "inferred"`
- `failure_reason: null`

The null selection fields are intentional for this first input prime. The search interval has
no positive-offset open composite integer before the inferred right endpoint.

## Failure Contract

If the law cannot prove unique next-prime inference, pure mode must output:

- `inference_status: "failed_closed"`
- `failure_reason: "NO_UNIQUE_BOUNDARY"`
- `rule_set_version: "boundary_law_001"`

It must not guess, validate inline, scan to a prime endpoint, or fall back to
Milestone 0 behavior silently.

## Why This Is PGS Inference

The law is PGS inference only if the outputted next-prime value follows from the input prime,
the wheel-closed pre-open interval, and the explicit empty-search-interval closure rule.
The external audit may later confirm the outputted `q_hat`, but that confirmation
cannot participate in the generation step.

## First Test Input Prime

The first test input prime is `11`.

Milestone 1 succeeds at the first hard target when pure mode outputs one
`boundary_law_001` record from input prime `11`, and external audit afterward
confirms that outputted next-prime value.

The stretch target is `N > 1` consecutive inferred next primes. That target
requires an additional law or a generalized version of this one; this note does
not claim that generalization.

## Acceptance Criteria

Next-Prime Law 001 may be implemented behind `--rule-set boundary_law_001` only
after the unresolved next-prime uniqueness condition is closed.

The implementation must satisfy the existing forbidden-dependency gate. The pure
path must still default to the Milestone 0 fail-closed scaffold unless the rule
set is explicitly selected.

## Falsification Conditions

Next-Prime Law 001 fails if:

- the pure path uses a forbidden helper;
- the rule hardcodes the outputted next-prime value;
- the rule only identifies a candidate and calls it a endpoint;
- audit rejects the outputted `q_hat`;
- generation and validation become coupled;
- the rule cannot explain why the endpoint is unique.
