# Current Headline Results

- **Unconditional GWR through the bounded Dusart regime.** The exact parallel
  finite scan now reaches $p < 1{,}000{,}000{,}001$, and the conservative
  Dusart/Nicolas-Robin bridge still covers the bounded tail through
  $p \le 5{,}571{,}362{,}243{,}795$. So `GWR` is now unconditional on that
  full range. The exact artifact
  [../output/gwr_proof/parallel_no_early_spoiler_1e9.json](../output/gwr_proof/parallel_no_early_spoiler_1e9.json)
  records `42,101,885` gaps, `149,214,917` earlier candidates, `0` spoilers,
  `0` bridge failures, and maximum realized bridge load
  `3.749140087272451e-08`. See
  [../gwr/experiments/proof/parallel_no_early_spoiler_scan.py](../gwr/experiments/proof/parallel_no_early_spoiler_scan.py)
  and
  [../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_universal_lemma.md](../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_universal_lemma.md).
- **Conditional asymptotic tail remains explicit about its dependency.** Beyond
  $p > 5{,}571{,}362{,}243{,}795$, the bridge still uses BHP's
  $\theta = 0.525$ with provisional `A = 1`. The helper
  [../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_certificate.py](../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_certificate.py)
  records the provisional BHP thresholds `102` for $c=\ln(2)e^\gamma$ and
  `3,544` for conservative `c = 1.5379`, alongside the bounded unconditional
  Dusart regime.
- **Unconditional exact DNI/GWR next-prime oracle.** The repository now
  carries an exact next-prime walker in unbounded form. Given a known prime
  `q`, the oracle scans divisor counts to the right until the first prime
  boundary, takes the lexicographic minimum over the composite interior, and
  recovers the next prime by the witness map. In plain terms, the next prime
  is recovered from the ordered divisor structure of the next-gap interior.
  That mechanism is exact by construction at any scale. See
  [./research/predictor/gwr_dni_exact_recursive_prime_walk_note.md](./research/predictor/gwr_dni_exact_recursive_prime_walk_note.md).
- **Dynamic bounded walker replaces the falsified fixed theorem.** The old
  fixed map `{2:44, 4:60, 6:60}` is false. It fails at `q = 24,098,209`,
  where the square branch gives `E(q) = 72 > 60`. The current bounded walker
  uses `C(q) = max(64, ceil(0.5 * log(q)^2))`. The square-branch audit through
  `p <= 10^6` tested `78,498` prime squares, found `7,477` fixed-map
  violations, and observed maximum square offset `246`. See
  [../benchmarks/python/predictor/square_branch_gap_audit.py](../benchmarks/python/predictor/square_branch_gap_audit.py)
  and
  [../benchmarks/python/predictor/gwr_dni_recursive_walk.py](../benchmarks/python/predictor/gwr_dni_recursive_walk.py).
- **Verified recursive walk surface.** On the combined exact $10^6 + 10^7$
  next-gap surface, the DNI transition rule is exact on
  `743,075 / 743,075` rows. The recursive walk records
  `664,578 / 664,578` exact consecutive next-prime recoveries from prime `11`
  through prime `10,000,121` with `0` skipped gaps, and the sampled decade
  ladder from $10^2$ through $10^18$ stayed at exact hit rate `1.0` with `0`
  skipped gaps across `860` measured recursive steps. This is the current
  verified no-skip sequential recovery surface. See
  [./research/predictor/gwr_dni_exact_recursive_prime_walk_note.md](./research/predictor/gwr_dni_exact_recursive_prime_walk_note.md).
- **Built-in falsification instrument.** The predictor walker now ships with a
  compare mode that runs the bounded and unbounded walkers in lockstep and
  records any bounded miss immediately. See
  [../benchmarks/python/predictor/gwr_dni_recursive_walk.py](../benchmarks/python/predictor/gwr_dni_recursive_walk.py).
- **Formal theorem statement.** The current headline theorem is
  [../gwr/findings/gwr_hierarchical_local_dominator_theorem.md](../gwr/findings/gwr_hierarchical_local_dominator_theorem.md).
  It states the winner law directly in hierarchical first-arrival and
  local-dominator form.
- **Exact full left-flank scan through $2 \times 10^7$.** The committed
  artifact
  [../output/gwr_proof/earlier_spoiler_local_dominator_scan_2e7.json](../output/gwr_proof/earlier_spoiler_local_dominator_scan_2e7.json)
  reports `1,163,198` gaps, `3,349,874` earlier candidates, and `0`
  unresolved.
- **Exact no-early-spoiler surface through $10^9$.** The committed aggregate
  artifact
  [../output/gwr_proof/parallel_no_early_spoiler_1e9.json](../output/gwr_proof/parallel_no_early_spoiler_1e9.json)
  reports `42,101,885` gaps, `149,214,917` earlier candidates before the true
  `GWR` carrier, `0` exact earlier spoilers, and maximum realized bridge load
  `3.749140087272451e-08`. The scanner writes deterministic per-segment JSON
  checkpoints and aggregates them exactly with padded left-endpoint semantics,
  so the $10^9$ surface is fully reproducible from the same code path.
- **Square-adjacent stress test at $10^{12}$.** The matched pre-square and
  post-square artifact
  [../output/gwr_proof/earlier_spoiler_local_dominator_scan_square_adjacent_1e12.json](../output/gwr_proof/earlier_spoiler_local_dominator_scan_square_adjacent_1e12.json)
  reports `137,771` gaps, `649,769` earlier candidates, and `0` unresolved.
- **Proof bridge certificate.** The note
  [../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_universal_lemma.md](../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_universal_lemma.md)
  derives the large-$p$ bridge as an explicit-constant task, and
  the helper
  [../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_certificate.py](../gwr/experiments/proof/proof_bridge_certificate.py)
  checks concrete gap-bound and divisor-growth parameter choices against the
  exact finite base already committed in the repo. The current proof-facing
  status is therefore: the bridge is unconditional through the bounded Dusart
  regime up to $p \le 5{,}571{,}362{,}243{,}795$, while the asymptotic tail to
  infinity remains conditional on an explicit leading constant for a
  fixed-exponent gap bound such as effective BHP.
- **No-Later-Simpler-Composite condition.** Once the implemented winner
  appears inside a tested prime gap, the next prime arrives before any later
  interior composite with strictly smaller divisor count. The dedicated closure
  study reports zero observed violations on a deterministic even-band ladder at
  every decade from $10^8$ through $10^{18}$. This is the closure law behind
  the exact recursive walk: after the winner appears, the gap does not later
  produce a simpler composite before the next prime boundary. See the
  [../gwr/findings/no_later_simpler_composite_theorem.md](../gwr/findings/no_later_simpler_composite_theorem.md)
  and the
  [../gwr/findings/closure_constraint_findings.md](../gwr/findings/closure_constraint_findings.md).
- **Dominant $d=4$ reduction.** In the dominant winner regime, the tested gaps
  admit no interior prime square, and the implemented winner is exactly the
  first interior carrier with $d(n)=4$. This holds on exact full scans at
  $10^6$ and $2 \times 10^7$ and on the deterministic even-band ladder through
  $10^{18}$, while the stricter semiprime-only wording is explicitly falsified
  by a thin prime-cube exception family. See the
  [../gwr/findings/dominant_d4_arrival_reduction_findings.md](../gwr/findings/dominant_d4_arrival_reduction_findings.md)
  and the
  [../gwr/findings/square_exclusion_first_d4_theorem.md](../gwr/findings/square_exclusion_first_d4_theorem.md).
- **Deterministic prefilter performance.** The current production Python path
  rejects about $91\%$ of tested odd candidates before Miller-Rabin and
  produced $2.09\times$ and $2.82\times$ end-to-end deterministic RSA
  key-generation speedups on the curated $2048$-bit and $4096$-bit benchmark
  corpora. See [./prefilter/benchmarks.md](./prefilter/benchmarks.md).
