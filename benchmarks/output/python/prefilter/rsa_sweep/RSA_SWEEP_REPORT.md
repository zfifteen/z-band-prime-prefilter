# RSA Sweep Benchmark Report

This report benchmarks the deterministic RSA key-generation pipeline across
the fixed sweep schedule up to the requested RSA ceiling. Its invariant target is
the **Divisor Curvature Identity** (DCI) $Z(n) = n^{1 - d(n)/2}$.

## Configuration

- `public_exponent`: 65537
- `rsa_sizes`: [512, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096]
- `keypair_counts`: [100, 100, 50, 20, 10]
