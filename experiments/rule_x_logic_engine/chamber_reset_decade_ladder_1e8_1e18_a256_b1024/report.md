# Search Interval-Reset Decade Ladder: 10^8 Through 10^18

## Executive Summary

Rule X with search-interval reset produced full coverage on the decade-window ladder.

```text
decades: 10^8 through 10^18
input primes per decade: 256
candidate bound: 1024
input primes tested: 2816
exact matches: 2816
coverage: 100.000000%
unresolved: 0
false outputs: 0
candidate-bound misses: 0
total runtime: 36.951566 seconds
```

The previous Rule X output rule resolved `513 / 2816` input primes. The
search-interval-reset rule converted the remaining `2303` tail cases by classifying
later unresolved candidates as post-endpoint search interval material.

## Tested Rule

For an input prime `p`, let `r` be the first resolved survivor under the
existing Rule X stack.

The search-interval-reset rule is:

```text
r closes the current p search interval.
Any later unresolved candidate belongs to a later search interval.
Output r as q_hat.
```

The rule does not create the first survivor. It classifies the unresolved tail
after a survivor has already been resolved.

## Aggregate Totals

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Input primes tested | `2816` |
| Exact matches | `2816` |
| Coverage | `100.000000%` |
| Unresolved | `0` |
| False outputs | `0` |
| Candidate-bound misses | `0` |
| Tail cases converted | `2303` |
| Tail candidates excluded | `77457` |
| Total runtime | `36.951566` seconds |

## Interpretation

The unresolved input primes were not missing the endpoint. They already contained
the endpoint as the first resolved survivor.

The search-interval-reset rule resolves the remaining ambiguity:

```text
p ... first_resolved_survivor ... later_unresolved_tail
      ^ current endpoint         ^ later search-interval material
```

Within this decade-window regime, Rule X plus search-interval reset reaches complete
audited coverage.

## Scope

This is a decade-window experiment, not exhaustive coverage of every prime
through `10^18`. Classical labels are used for input prime selection and downstream
audit in the experiment harness. The next engineering step is promotion into
the minimal generator path while preserving the two-key output contract.
