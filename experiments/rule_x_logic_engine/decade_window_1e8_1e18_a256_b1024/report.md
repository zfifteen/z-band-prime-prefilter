# Rule X Decade Window Report: 10^8 Through 10^18

## Executive Summary

The Rule X decade-window ladder tested `256` consecutive input primes at each
decade from `10^8` through `10^18`.

Across the full ladder:

```text
decade windows: 11
input primes tested: 2816
candidate hypotheses evaluated: 768077
exact unique matches: 513
true next prime rejections: 0
candidate-bound misses: 0
total runtime: 36.020993 seconds
```

Every decade window preserved the hard safety invariant:

```text
true_boundary_rejected_count = 0
```

The `10^18` window produced:

```text
input primes tested: 256
candidate hypotheses evaluated: 69819
exact unique matches: 37
match rate: 14.453125%
true next prime rejections: 0
runtime: 12.167169 seconds
```

## Important Scope Note

This is a high-scale window experiment, not exhaustive coverage of every prime
through `10^18`.

For this decade ladder, the experiment uses exact factorization as the
positive-witness oracle inside each finite window. That lets the same Rule X
candidate-elimination logic be measured at `10^18` without requiring a
trial-division witness horizon near `sqrt(10^18)`.

The Rule X decision shape is unchanged:

```text
candidate hypotheses
positive composite witnesses
unresolved interior holds
selected-integer lock after resolved survivor
lower-divisor threat ceiling
unique resolved survivor output
downstream audit
```

Classical labels are used for input prime selection and audit. The reported result
is a decade-window measurement of the logic engine, not a production generator
claim.

## Interpretation

The decade ladder supports the high-scale stability of the Rule X
consistency-collapse mechanism on deterministic windows through `10^18`.

The match rate varies by decade but remains nontrivial at every scale. The
`10^18` window resolves `37 / 256` input primes while rejecting the true next prime
zero times.

Runtime increases with scale because high-scale exact factorization is used to
materialize positive witnesses in the window. The logic engine itself remains
small and deterministic; the high-scale measurement cost is dominated by the
classical witness oracle used for this experiment.
