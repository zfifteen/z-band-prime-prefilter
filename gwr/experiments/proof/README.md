# GWR Proof Scripts

This folder is for executable scripts that probe, stress-test, and support
proof work on the `Gap Winner Rule` (`GWR`).

The current scripts in this folder are research instruments.
They are not part of the validation registry, and none of them by itself is a
mandatory proof gate for `GWR`.

They target the exact missing universal step identified in the findings notes:

- the ordered-dominance theorem already proves that the `GWR` candidate beats
  every later interior composite,
- the remaining proof task is to eliminate every earlier higher-divisor
  spoiler.

## Current Entry Point

- [`earlier_spoiler_scan.py`](./earlier_spoiler_scan.py):
  exact interval scan that
  - identifies the `GWR` candidate in each tested prime gap,
  - checks every earlier interior composite against that candidate using exact
    integer-power score comparison,
  - and records which earlier candidates are already eliminated by the current
    spoiler-bound reduction.
- [`finite_remainder_attempt.py`](./finite_remainder_attempt.py):
  deterministic class-only route test that
  - attempts to derive an explicit finite remainder bound from the current
    spoiler reduction,
  - and emits the exact obstruction family showing that the current reduction
    alone does not close the infinite tail.
- [`large_prime_reducer.py`](./large_prime_reducer.py):
  deterministic proof-pursuit reducer that
  - exhaustively scans every prime gap below a fixed explicit large-prime
    threshold,
  - then tests a fixed-factor large-prime class table against the exact
    earlier-spoiler inequality,
  - and emits the remaining large-prime divisor classes, if any.
- [`large_prime_tail_obstruction.py`](./large_prime_tail_obstruction.py):
  deterministic tail-obstruction script that
  - uses the exact family $D = 2^k$ with primorial witnesses,
  - finds the first exact class witness against the fixed large-prime reducer,
  - and finds the eventual cutoff after which the elementary Bertrand bound
    alone keeps that family unresolved forever.
- [`earlier_spoiler_local_dominator_scan.py`](./earlier_spoiler_local_dominator_scan.py):
  exact prime-gap admissibility scan that
  - takes each actual earlier spoiler candidate before the `GWR` winner,
  - finds the first later interior composite that beats it exactly,
  - and records the offset law and per-class offset frontier.
