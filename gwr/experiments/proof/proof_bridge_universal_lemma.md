# Proof Bridge for the No-Early-Spoiler Condition

This note isolates the remaining analytic bridge needed for a universal proof
of the `Gap Winner Rule` (`GWR`).

It does **not** claim that the full universal theorem is already closed in this
repo. Its job is narrower:

- restate the exact no-early-spoiler target in one normalized quantity,
- derive a fully non-empirical large-$p$ bridge from gap geometry and divisor
  growth bounds,
- and state precisely what finite verification obligation remains.

## 1. Reduction Already Established

The ordered dominance theorem is already proved in
[`../../gwr/findings/lexicographic_raw_z_dominance_theorem.md`](../../gwr/findings/lexicographic_raw_z_dominance_theorem.md):

for composite integers $a < b$, if $d(a) \le d(b)$, then

$$L(a) > L(b).$$

where

$$L(n) = \left(1 - \frac{d(n)}{2}\right)\ln(n).$$

So inside a prime gap, once the leftmost minimum-divisor carrier $w$ appears,
every later candidate is already eliminated.

The only missing universal step is the earlier side:

for every earlier interior candidate $k < w$ with

$$\delta = d(k) - d_{\min} \ge 1.$$

prove

$$L(k) < L(w).$$

Equivalently,

$$\frac{\ln w}{\ln k} < 1 + \frac{\delta}{d_{\min} - 2}.$$

## 2. Normalized Bridge Load

Define the dimensionless bridge quantity

$$B(k,w) = \frac{\frac{\ln w}{\ln k} - 1}{\frac{\delta}{d_{\min} - 2}}.$$

$$B(k,w) < 1.$$

This is equivalent to $L(k) < L(w)$.

This is the normalized quantity measured directly by
[`asymptotic_bridge_load_scan.py`](./asymptotic_bridge_load_scan.py).

## 3. Deterministic Upper Bound On The Numerator

Let $g(p) = q - p$ denote the prime gap.

For any earlier candidate $k$ and winner $w$ in the gap interior,

$$w - k \le g(p).$$

Since

$$\ln(1 + x) \le x \text{ for } x > -1.$$

one has

$$\ln\frac{w}{k} = \ln\left(1 + \frac{w - k}{k}\right) \le \frac{w - k}{k} \le \frac{g(p)}{p+1} < \frac{g(p)}{p}.$$

Because $\ln k > \ln p$, it follows that

$$\frac{\ln w}{\ln k} - 1 = \frac{\ln(w/k)}{\ln k} < \frac{g(p)}{p \ln p}.$$

So the bridge numerator is controlled purely by gap geometry.

## 4. Deterministic Lower Bound On The Denominator

For every earlier candidate,

$$\delta \ge 1.$$

So

$$\frac{\delta}{d_{\min} - 2} \ge \frac{1}{d_{\min} - 2}.$$

Now use any explicit maximal-order upper bound for the divisor function, for
example a Nicolas-Robin style majoration of the form

$$d(n) \le \exp\left(c \frac{\ln n}{\ln\ln n}\right)$$

for all sufficiently large $n$, with an effective absolute constant $c > 0$.

Since $w$ lies in the gap interior near $p$, this gives

$$d_{\min} - 2 \le \exp\left(c \frac{\ln p}{\ln\ln p}\right)$$

for all sufficiently large $p$, hence

$$\frac{\delta}{d_{\min} - 2} \ge \exp\left(-c \frac{\ln p}{\ln\ln p}\right).$$

So the bridge denominator is bounded below by a subpolynomial term.

## 5. Universal Large-$p$ Bridge

Combine the numerator and denominator bounds:

$$B(k,w) < \frac{g(p)}{p \ln p} \cdot \exp\left(c \frac{\ln p}{\ln\ln p}\right).$$

Now assume any proved prime-gap upper bound of the form

$$g(p) \le p^\theta$$

for all sufficiently large $p$, with some fixed $\theta < 1$.

Then

$$B(k,w) < p^{\theta - 1} (\ln p)^{-1} \exp\left(c \frac{\ln p}{\ln\ln p}\right) = p^{\theta - 1 + o(1)}.$$

Because $\theta < 1$, the exponent $\theta - 1 + o(1)$ is eventually
negative. Therefore

$$B(k,w) \to 0 \text{ as } p \to \infty.$$

So there exists an effective threshold $N_{\mathrm{bridge}}$ such that for all
prime gaps with left endpoint $p \ge N_{\mathrm{bridge}}$,

$$B(k,w) < 1.$$

for every earlier candidate $k$.

This is the universal large-$p$ lemma.

## 6. What Remains To Close The Universal Theorem

This note does **not** by itself finish the theorem in repo-proof form.

To close the universal statement of `GWR`, two concrete tasks remain:

1. choose explicit literature constants for
   - one effective divisor-function majoration, and
   - one effective prime-gap upper bound with exponent $\theta < 1$;
2. compute an explicit numerical threshold $N_{\mathrm{bridge}}$ and verify
   every gap up to that threshold.

The current repo already supplies exact finite verification through
$2 \cdot 10^7$ via the committed no-early-spoiler artifacts. If the explicit
bridge threshold comes out below that bound, the universal theorem closes
immediately. If it comes out above, the remaining work is a finite deterministic
extension of the exact scan up to that threshold.

## 7. Current Role Of The Exact Artifacts

The exact artifacts do not replace the bridge proof.

They serve two narrower roles:

- they certify the finite base already covered exactly in the repo,
- and they identify the right normalized quantity for the remaining large-$p$
  argument.

That is enough to make the remaining gap precise:

the universal theorem is reduced to one explicit-constant bridge computation
plus finite verification up to the resulting threshold.
