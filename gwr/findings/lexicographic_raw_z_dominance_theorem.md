# Lexicographic Raw-Z Dominance Theorem

## Theorem

Let

`Z(n) = (1 - d(n)/2) ln(n)`

for every composite integer `n`, where `d(n)` is the divisor count of `n`.

Let `a` and `b` be composite integers with `a < b`. If

`d(a) <= d(b)`,

then

`Z(a) > Z(b)`.

Equivalently, along increasing composite integers, raw-`Z` is strictly ordered
by the partial order

- smaller divisor count first,
- and, for equal divisor count, smaller integer first.

## Proof

For a composite integer `n`, one has `d(n) >= 3`. Define

`alpha(n) = d(n)/2 - 1`.

Then `alpha(n) >= 1/2 > 0`, and the score may be rewritten as

`Z(n) = -(d(n)/2 - 1) ln(n) = -alpha(n) ln(n)`.

Now let `a` and `b` be composite integers with `a < b` and `d(a) <= d(b)`.

Set

`A = alpha(a),  B = alpha(b)`.

Since `d(a) <= d(b)`, one has `A <= B`. Since `a < b` and `ln(x)` is strictly
increasing on `(0, infinity)`, one has `ln(a) < ln(b)`.

Because `A > 0`, it follows that

`A ln(a) < A ln(b)`.

Because `A <= B` and `ln(b) > 0`, it follows that

`A ln(b) <= B ln(b)`.

Combining the two inequalities gives

`A ln(a) < B ln(b)`.

Multiplying by `-1` reverses the inequality:

`-A ln(a) > -B ln(b)`.

Substituting back `Z(a) = -A ln(a)` and `Z(b) = -B ln(b)` yields

`Z(a) > Z(b)`.

This proves the claim.

## Corollary

Let `S = {n_1 < n_2 < ... < n_k}` be a finite nonempty increasing list of
composite integers such that, whenever `i < j`, one has

`d(n_i) <= d(n_j)`

for the winner `n_i` against every later candidate `n_j`.

Then `n_i` is the unique maximizer of `Z` on `S`.

In particular, if the interior composites of a prime gap satisfy this ordered
divisor condition relative to the lexicographic winner, then the raw-`Z`
winner is exactly the Gap Winner Rule winner.

## Remark

The stress-test surface rules out a stronger unrestricted global claim. It is
not true in general that

`d(a) < d(b) => Z(a) > Z(b)`

for arbitrary unordered composite pairs.

One explicit counterexample is

- `a = 49`, `d(a) = 3`, `Z(a) = -1.945910149...`
- `b = 6`, `d(b) = 4`, `Z(b) = -1.791759469...`

Here `d(a) < d(b)` but `Z(a) < Z(b)`.

So the exact theorem supported by the current algebra and stress tests is a
lexicographic dominance theorem in the ordered direction: lower-or-equal
divisor count wins only when it also occurs at the earlier integer.

This keeps the theorem narrow and correct. The separate prime-gap question is
whether the interior divisor profile of a prime gap always places the
lexicographic winner in precisely that ordered-dominance regime.
