# No-Early-Spoiler Margin Findings

This note records the executed exact margin scan from
[`no_early_spoiler_margin_scan.py`](../experiments/proof/no_early_spoiler_margin_scan.py).

The target is the actual unresolved universal step behind `GWR`:

for the true gap carrier

$$w = \min\{m \in G : d(m) = d_{\min}\}.$$

does every earlier interior composite $k < w$ satisfy

$$L(k) < L(w)?$$

The ordered-dominance theorem already removes every later candidate. This scan
measures the exact slack against the true `GWR` carrier itself.

## Recorded Margins

For every earlier candidate $k < w$, the scan records two equivalent positive
quantities:

1. the direct log-score margin

$$L(w) - L(k),$$

2. the critical-ratio margin

$$\frac{d(k) - 2}{d_{\min} - 2} - \frac{\ln w}{\ln k}.$$

The second quantity is the direct slack in the exact spoiler condition:

$$\frac{\ln w}{\ln k} \ge \frac{d(k) - 2}{d_{\min} - 2}.$$

So a positive critical-ratio margin means the earlier composite is still safely
below spoiler threshold.

## Current Executed Artifact

- [`no_early_spoiler_margin_scan_2e7.json`](../../output/gwr_proof/no_early_spoiler_margin_scan_2e7.json)

## Strongest Supported Result

On the full exact surface through $2 \cdot 10^7$:

- `1163198` prime gaps with composite interior,
- `3349874` earlier interior candidates before the true `GWR` carrier,
- `0` exact earlier spoilers against that carrier.

So on the current exact surface, the no-early-spoiler condition itself holds
with zero counterexamples.

The scan also records the current tightest margins on that surface:

- smallest direct log-score margin:
  $$L(w) - L(k) \approx 0.9808292530$$
  at the gap $(7, 11)$ with earlier candidate $8$ and winner $9$;
- smallest critical-ratio margin:
  $$\frac{d(k) - 2}{d_{\min} - 2} - \frac{\ln w}{\ln k} \approx 0.0714285168$$
  at the gap $(2486509, 2486513)$ with earlier candidate
  $2486510$, winner $2486512$, winner class $d_{\min}=30$, and earlier class
  $d=32$.

So the smallest direct score slack and the smallest ratio-form slack come from
different regimes. The tiny-gap edge case controls the direct score minimum,
while the tightest ratio cases move into higher divisor classes where the
critical ratio lies much closer to $1$.

## What This Adds Beyond The Local-Dominator Scan

The earlier local-dominator artifact already showed that every earlier
candidate eventually loses to some later admissible composite.

This margin scan is stronger in the direction that matters for `GWR`:

- it compares every earlier candidate directly to the actual winner carrier
  $w$,
- it records the tightest direct log-score slack,
- and it records the tightest critical-ratio slack in the exact spoiler
  inequality.

So this is the current exact measurement surface for the no-early-spoiler
condition itself, not just for later admissible rescue.

## Current Reading

The strongest supported claim from this artifact is:

on the exact through-$2 \cdot 10^7$ surface, every earlier higher-divisor
candidate is already beaten by the actual leftmost minimum-divisor carrier, and
the scan records the tightest direct and ratio-form safety margins for that
fact.

This scan by itself is the finite base, not the full universal theorem. The
bridge certificate now supplies the missing large-$p$ step: under BHP's
$\theta = 0.525$ and the recorded divisor-function constants, the analytic
threshold lands below the exact $2 \cdot 10^7$ base.

So this artifact is now part of the proof closure rather than only an empirical
margin report.
