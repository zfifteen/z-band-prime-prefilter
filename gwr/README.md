# Gap Winner Rule

This subtree is the forward home for the `Gap Winner Rule` (`GWR`).

`GWR` is the preferred name going forward for the rule previously recorded in
this repo as the `Lexicographic Winner-Take-All Peak Rule`. The legacy name is
retained in older artifacts so existing reports, figures, scripts, and links do
not have to be rewritten.

## Core Statement

Inside a prime gap $(p, q)$ with at least one composite interior, define the
raw-$Z$ score of an interior integer $n$ by

$$
Z(n) = \left(1 - \frac{d(n)}{2}\right)\ln(n).
$$

The `Gap Winner Rule` says the raw-$Z$ winner is exactly the lexicographic
winner:

1. minimize the interior divisor count $d(n)$,
2. among ties, choose the leftmost interior integer.

Any gap where the raw-$Z$ argmax differs from that winner is a counterexample.

## Current Headline Status

The no-early-spoiler bridge is now closed below the repo's exact finite base
under BHP's $\theta = 0.525$ and explicit Robin-style divisor-function
majoration constants.

The exact finite bridge artifact through $p < 20{,}000{,}001$ records
`1,163,198` gaps, `3,349,874` earlier candidates, `0` bridge failures, and
maximum realized bridge load `0.05664166714743768`. The analytic bridge
threshold is `102` under $c=\ln(2)e^\gamma$ and `3,544` under conservative
`c = 1.5379`, both inside that finite base.

## Naming Convention

Use this form on first mention in new artifacts:

`Gap Winner Rule (GWR; legacy: Lexicographic Winner-Take-All Peak Rule)`

After first mention, use `GWR`.
